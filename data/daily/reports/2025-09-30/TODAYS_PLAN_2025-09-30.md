# ⚠️ RISK MANAGEMENT

## SHORGAN-BOT Risks
- **Binary FDA events**: 3 positions with approval risk
- **Short position**: TLRY could squeeze (small size)
- **CRS momentum**: Could reverse quickly (use trailing stops)
- **Overall**: High risk/reward profile appropriate for strategy

## DEE-BOT Risks
- **Beta drift**: Monitor and rebalance if >0.15 from target
- **Market pullback**: Defensive positions should cushion
- **Dividend cuts**: Unlikely with PG/JNJ/PEP/ABBV quality
- **Overall**: Low risk, stable profile

## Portfolio-Level Risks
- **Concentration**: Each position sized appropriately
- **Correlation**: DEE positions negatively correlated with SHORGAN
- **Liquidity**: All tickers liquid (>1M ADV)
- **Cash**: Adequate reserves in both accounts
