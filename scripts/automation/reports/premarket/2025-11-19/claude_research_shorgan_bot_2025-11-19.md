## 9. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Portfolio Heat Analysis:**
- Current at-risk capital: $18,500 (17.5% of portfolio)
- After new positions: $24,000 (22.6% of portfolio)
- Maximum acceptable: 25% (within limits)

**Position Concentration:**
- Largest position (ARQT): 17.2% of portfolio - TRIM REQUIRED
- No single position should exceed 15%
- Biotech exposure: 35% (elevated but justified by catalyst clustering)

**Correlation Risk:**
- Quantum computing names (IONQ, RGTI, ARQQ): Reduce by covering IONQ short
- Energy shorts (CVX, CIVI): Manageable at current size
- Biotech longs: Diversified across different catalysts

**Catalyst Timing:**
- November 19-22: Heavy catalyst week (6 binary events)
- Stagger entries to avoid overexposure
- Keep 20% cash for opportunities

**Stop Loss Discipline:**
- All positions have defined stops
- Binary events: Wider stops but smaller positions
- Momentum trades: Tight stops (5-7%)
- Never average down on shorts

**Maximum Loss Scenarios:**
- Per trade max loss: 2% of portfolio
- Weekly max loss tolerance: 8%
- If hit 5% weekly loss: Stop all new trades

**Hedging Strategy:**
- Maintain SPY long position
- IONQ put spread provides downside protection
- VIX calls if market volatility spikes

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
1. Exit SRRK short immediately - losing control
2. Size down on binary events - these are lottery tickets
3. Take profits on winners - don't get greedy
4. Watch for correlated moves in quantum names
5. Keep powder dry for post-Thanksgiving opportunities

---

**SHORGAN-BOT SIGN-OFF:**
Week 12 brings an absolute tsunami of catalysts. We're positioned for aggressive gains but must maintain discipline. Multiple 50%+ moves possible this week. The key is surviving the binary events while maximizing upside. Lock and load, but keep those stops tight. Let's print money while DEE-BOT sits on her index funds.

*Fortune favors the bold, but only if they manage risk.*
