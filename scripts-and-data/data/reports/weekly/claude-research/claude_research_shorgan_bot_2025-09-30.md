## 6. MONITORING PLAN

**CATALYST TIMELINE:**
- **October 1**: Execute exits (EMBC, GPK) and entries (VKTX, TMDX, PRTA)
- **October 3**: Monitor TMDX earnings pre-market
- **October 7-9**: FDA meetings and PDUFA dates for VKTX, PRTA
- **October 10**: Evaluate catalyst outcomes, adjust positions

**TECHNICAL TRIGGERS:**
- **RGTI**: Trail stop at $26.50 (10% below current)
- **SAVA**: Watch for break above $3.20 for additional upside
- **VKTX**: Stop loss $27.00, target $45.00

- **PRTA**: Stop loss $28.00, target $52.00

**RISK MANAGEMENT:**
- Maximum 15% stop loss on all new positions
- Catalyst failure = immediate exit regardless of technical levels
- Position size capped at 10% per holding
- No leverage, no options - pure equity catalyst plays

**PORTFOLIO OPTIMIZATION:**
Priority exit non-compliant large-cap positions (CVX, PG, UNH, SPY) to focus capital on micro/mid-cap catalyst opportunities. Target 90% allocation to sub-$300M market cap companies with binary catalysts.

**CONVICTION LEVEL: HIGH** 
Three Tier 1 catalyst plays with 3.5-4.2x R/R ratios and specific October dates. Biotech catalyst season beginning with multiple FDA events clustered in next 10 days.
