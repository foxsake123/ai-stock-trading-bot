## 5. RISK AND LIQUIDITY CHECKS

### Liquidity Analysis
- **Concern:** AAPL, CVX, XOM showing wide spreads (7-18%)
- **Solution:** Use conservative limit orders, avoid market orders
- **Execution:** Stage sells over 2 days to minimize impact

### Position Sizing Risk
- **Current Risk:** 4 positions >15% creates concentration
- **Target Risk:** Max 8% per position reduces single-stock risk by 60%
- **Beta Impact:** Additions (JNJ 0.7, KO 0.6, VZ 0.4, NEE 0.8) will lower portfolio beta to ~0.95

### Stop Loss Management
**Current Positions (Post-Rebalancing):**
- AAPL: Stop at $230.00 (-8%)
- CVX: Stop at $143.00 (-8%)  
- JPM: Stop at $290.00 (-8%)
- MSFT: Stop at $474.00 (-8%)
- PG: Stop at $141.00 (-8%)
- XOM: Stop at $104.00 (-8%)

### Dividend Safety Check
**New Portfolio Yield Projection:** 3.4%
- 8 of 10 positions above 2% threshold
- Combined payout ratio: <55% (safe)
- No dividend cuts in target companies last 5 years
