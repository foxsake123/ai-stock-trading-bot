  "raw_text": "Here are the data\u2011driven trade recommendations for both bots, ready to be scheduled at 7\u202fAM ET each trading day. I\u2019ve kept things concise and cited the research used.\n\n1. Shorgan\u2011Bot (Micro\u2011/Mid\u2011Cap Strategy)\nTicker\tAllocation\tCatalyst & Rationale\tData Source\nBRCHF (BrainChip)\t10\u202f%\tNeuromorphic\u2011computing micro\u2011cap. The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory awarded BrainChip a $1.8\u202fmillion contract, moving it to Phase\u00a0II of the Small Business Innovation Research program\nmarketbeat.com\n. This milestone could lead to military adoption and revenue growth.\tMarketBeat report\nmarketbeat.com\n\nMYO (Myomo)\t10\u202f%\tHealthcare micro\u2011cap. Myomo\u2019s MyoPro robotic arm device saw revenue growth accelerate from 9\u202f% to over 80\u202f% in 2024 and received its first CMS lump\u2011sum reimbursements\nmarketbeat.com\n. CMS reimbursement doubles the addressable market and validates the product\nmarketbeat.com\n.\tMarketBeat report\nmarketbeat.com\n\nFARO (FARO Technologies)\t10\u202f%\tSmall\u2011cap 3D metrology company. FARO returned to positive operating margins and is launching new products (Quantum Arm\u00a0X and Focus Premium Max), with analysts expecting sales growth to resume by late 2025\nmarketbeat.com\n.\tMarketBeat report\nmarketbeat.com\n\nRisk management: Use limit orders near current prices (e.g., MYO ~\u202f$0.85, BRCHF ~\u202f$0.28, FARO ~\u202f$30\u2013$40) and set stop\u2011losses roughly 20\u202f% below entry. Keep the rest of the portfolio in cash or reserved for other opportunities to maintain agility. Daily review of catalysts is essential.\n\n2. Dee\u2011Bot (Beta\u2011Neutral, Large\u2011Cap Strategy)\n\nTrim NVDA (-20\u202f%): NVDA is the worst performer with a \u20130.64\u202f% unrealized P&L\nGitHub\n and adds volatility; reducing exposure lowers concentration risk.\n\nTrim AAPL & JPM (-10\u202f% each): These two positions account for ~44\u202f% of the portfolio value\nGitHub\n; partial trimming diversifies the weight.\n\nAdd JNJ, PG & WMT (each +5\u202f%): Diversify into defensive healthcare and consumer staples to maintain the strategy\u2019s beta\u2011neutral, low\u2011volatility mandate\nGitHub\n. These large\u2011cap names should help preserve capital while keeping portfolio beta close to 1.0.\n\nMaintain cash buffer (~3\u202f%)\nGitHub\n; review beta drift daily.\n\nThese recommendations keep DEE\u2011BOT aligned with its mandate: beta\u2011neutral positioning in S&P\u00a0100 stocks\nGitHub\n and low\u2011volatility, defensive exposure\nGitHub\n.\n\nScheduling\n\nBoth sets of recommendations should be generated and reviewed at 7\u202fAM ET every trading day. You can automate this by running your trade\u2011recommendation scripts (or the updated pre\u2011market report generators) on a cron schedule; the outputs will guide your agents\u2019 morning debates and subsequent orders.\n\nLet me know if you need help integrating these into your existing automation or if you\u2019d like further adjustments.",
