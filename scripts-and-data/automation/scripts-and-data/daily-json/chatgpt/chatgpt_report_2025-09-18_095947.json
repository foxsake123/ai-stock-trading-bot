Oil has slipped to ~$64, easing inflation pressure but capping energy.\n\nRisk Note: While risk-on sentiment dominates, Fed emphasized inflation is still above target; sharp data disappointments could reverse flows.\n\n2. Catalyst Trade Ideas (1\u201330 Day Horizon)\nINCY \u2013 Incyte Corp.\n\nCatalyst: FDA PDUFA Sept 19 (Opzelura cream, pediatric eczema).\n\nThesis: High-probability approval expands TAM; stock trades ~$84.\n\nEntry: $83\u201384.

Options Overlays & Hedging\n\nEvent Hedging: For binary biotechs (INCY, SRRK, FBIO), use call spreads to cap risk.\n\nPortfolio Hedge: Small allocation to SPY or IWM puts to cushion macro downside during Fed week.\n\nCovered Calls: For RIVN, consider Oct $17.5 covered calls to harvest premium if stock rallies to target.\n\n4. Risk & Stop Management\n\nRisk per trade: <1% of total capital (stop \u00d7 position size).\n\nStops: Tight for binary catalysts (INCY, $80); wider for trend/momentum plays (RIVN, $12.7).\n\nMax Drawdown: Portfolio exposure spread across 5 names, total active risk ~5% of equity.\n\nProfit-taking: Scale out at T1; trail stops higher into T2.\n\n5.

Portfolio Review & Adjustments\n\nOPEN (short $9.25): Stock squeezed to $10+ on new CEO + heavy short interest (26%); thesis invalidated. Close short to prevent further loss.\n\nCBRL (long $51): Earnings miss; shares \u201310%. Thesis (short squeeze on beat) failed. Exit to cut loss.\n\nINCY/RIVN: Maintain as above.\n\nLegacy holdings (NVDA, ORCL): Both large winners; consider trimming 20\u201330% to reduce concentration and recycle into catalysts.\n\nBYND/SAVA: Weak, no catalyst; exit and redeploy.\n\nSmall winners (BTBT +13%, RGTI +5%): Lock partial profit; trail stops.\n\n7. Suggested Data Sources\n\nFDA/PDUFA: BioPharmCatalyst, Benzinga FDA calendar.\n\nEarnings: Nasdaq, Zacks, EarningsWhispers.\n\nShort Interest: FINVIZ, Fintel.\n\nInsider Buys: MarketBeat, SEC Form 4 feeds.\n\nOptions Flow: Benzinga UOA, Market Chameleon.\n\n\u2705 TL;DR: Risk-on backdrop post-Fed cut. Focus on INCY (Sep 19 FDA) and SRRK (Sep 22 FDA) as top catalysts. Close OPEN short & CBRL long; recycle capital into higher-probability biotech and EV catalysts.\n\nWould you like me to also generate a one-page \u201ctrader\u2019s checklist\u201d PDF with the summary table and stop levels for quick reference at the desk each morning?",
