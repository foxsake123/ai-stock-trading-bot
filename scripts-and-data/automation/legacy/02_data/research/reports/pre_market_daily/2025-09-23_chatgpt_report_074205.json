Market Overview\n\nFutures point to a mixed open: S&P 500 flat, Nasdaq slightly higher on tech strength, Dow weighed down by energy.\n\nVolatility (VIX) stable around recent lows \u2014 no immediate stress signals.\n\nMacro: Fed rate-cut expectations have moderated; CPI/PCE data this week could shift sentiment.\n\n2.

Risk Check\n\nNegative cash balance must be corrected.\n\nConcentration risk: AAPL (~20%) and JPM (~19%) are near max recommended weights.\n\nSector bias: Overweight tech + energy, underweight healthcare/staples.\n\nBeta drift: At ~1.05, slightly above the neutral 1.0 target. Needs trimming of high-beta names.\n\n4.

Monitoring Plan\n\nStops active GTC for all positions (AAPL $240, MSFT $490, GOOGL $230, NVDA $170, JPM $290, JNJ $165, WMT $95, XOM $100, plus above for new buys).\n\nWatch Fed data releases (CPI/PCE) for rate-cut expectations \u2192 impacts NEE/UNH positively if rates ease.\n\nEarnings calendar: JPM mid-Oct, UNH Oct 13, Techs late Oct \u2014 potential catalysts.\n\nIf beta rises >1.15, consider trimming further high-beta tech or adding more utilities.\n\n7. Thesis Review Summary\n\nToday\u2019s plan rotates out of lagging defensives (PG), duplicative energy (CVX), and trims high-beta tech (NVDA, AAPL) to correct the cash deficit and rebalance risk. We redeploy into UNH (healthcare), NEE (utilities), and AMZN (discretionary) to diversify and align with sector outlooks. Portfolio beta resets closer to 1.0, cash turns positive (~+$20 buffer). Defensive ballast is strengthened while maintaining selective growth exposure.\n\nPositioning: Balanced, beta-neutral, defensive tilt intact, prepared for macro volatility.\n\nWould you like me to also generate the human-readable Alpaca execution JSON block alongside this pre-market table, so you can directly upload and run the orders?",
