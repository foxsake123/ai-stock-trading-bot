  "market_context": "U.S. equity markets are at an inflection point as of mid-September 2025. Small and mid-cap stocks have begun to outperform after lagging mega-caps. The Russell 2000 jumped ~7% in August amid expectations of a Federal Reserve rate cut at the September 16-17 FOMC meeting. A 25 bp Fed rate cut is widely anticipated, which would ease financing conditions for smaller companies. Market context favors catalyst-driven trades in micro-to-mid caps.",
