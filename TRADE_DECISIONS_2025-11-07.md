## 📊 FUBO Earnings Decision - DIFFERENT STRATEGIES

### SHORGAN-BOT Paper (1000 shares @ $4.07, -8%)

**❌ EXIT COMPLETELY**
- **Research verdict**: "DEAD MONEY - EXIT"
- **Reasons**: High cash burn, no near catalyst, consolidation fears
- **Action**: SELL 1000 shares @ $3.82 GTC
- **Loss**: ~$250 (cut losses)
- **Timing**: Execute tomorrow

### SHORGAN-BOT Live (27 shares @ $3.50, +7.4%)

**✅ HOLD BUT TRIM**
- **Research verdict**: "HOLD" - different strategy for profitable position
- **Reasons**:
  - Currently +$6.88 profit
  - Nov 18 catalyst still valid (streaming numbers)
  - Technical setup improving (ascending triangle)
- **Actions**:
  1. Sell 9 shares @ $4.05 (1/3 position trim)
  2. Keep 18 shares for Nov 18 catalyst
  3. Move stop loss up to $3.40 (protect principal)
  4. Exit plan: Sell 50% at $4.25, rest runs to $4.75

**Why Different?**
- Paper account: Losing position with no conviction
- Live account: Profitable position with catalyst runway
- Live account can be more patient with smaller position
