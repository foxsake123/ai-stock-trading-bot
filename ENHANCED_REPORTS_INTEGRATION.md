## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture

```
Portfolio Data (Alpaca API)
        ↓
get_portfolio_status.py
        ↓
parse_portfolio_status()
        ↓
generate_enhanced_morning_report()
        ↓
send_telegram_message()
        ↓
Telegram Bot API
        ↓
Your Mobile Device
```

### Data Flow

1. **Fetch Portfolio Data**
   ```python
   portfolio_output = get_portfolio_status()
   portfolio_data = parse_portfolio_status(portfolio_output)
   ```

2. **Read Today's Trades**
   ```python
   trades_content = read_todays_trades(date)
   trades = parse_trades_from_file(trades_content)
   ```

3. **Generate Enhanced Report**
   ```python
   report = generate_enhanced_morning_report(
       portfolio_data,
       trades,
       date
   )
   ```

4. **Send to Telegram**
   ```python
   send_telegram_message(bot_token, chat_id, report)

```

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Unicode Errors on Console
**Symptom:** `UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character`
**Cause:** Windows console can't display emoji characters
**Solution:** Already fixed! Enhanced script shows clean summary instead of full report
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue: Message Too Long
**Symptom:** Telegram message fails, error about 4096 character limit
**Solution:** Already implemented! Script automatically splits messages
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED

### Issue: Portfolio Data Not Available
**Symptom:** Report shows $0 values
**Cause:** Alpaca API connection issue
**Solution:** Check ALPACA_API_KEY and ALPACA_SECRET_KEY in `.env`
**Test:** `python scripts/performance/get_portfolio_status.py`

### Issue: No Trades Found
**Symptom:** Report shows "NO TRADES EXECUTED TODAY" (expected)
**Cause:** TODAYS_TRADES file doesn't exist for today
**Solution:** Normal if no trades generated/approved
**Generate:** `python scripts/automation/generate_todays_trades_v2.py`
