## Overview

The AI Stock Trading Bot operates **two independent portfolios** with distinct strategies designed to complement each other:

| Strategy | Style | Time Horizon | Risk Level | Target Return |
|----------|-------|--------------|------------|---------------|
| **SHORGAN-BOT** | Aggressive, catalyst-driven | 2-8 weeks | High | 15-25% per position |
| **DEE-BOT** | Defensive, income-focused | 3-12 months | Low | 8-12% annually + dividends |

**Philosophy:** By running two uncorrelated strategies, the system achieves better risk-adjusted returns than either strategy alone.

## SHORGAN-BOT Strategy

### Strategy Name Origin
**SHORGAN** = **SHOR**t-term + Or**GAN**ic Growth (catalyst-driven momentum trading)

### Investment Thesis

SHORGAN-BOT identifies **high-conviction, catalyst-driven trades** in small and mid-cap stocks where specific upcoming events (earnings, FDA approvals, mergers, product launches) are likely to drive significant price movements.

### Core Principles

1. **Catalyst-First Approach**
   - Every trade MUST have a specific, date-certain catalyst
   - Catalysts drive volatility, volatility creates opportunity
   - Time-bound trades reduce exposure to market noise

2. **Concentrated Positions**
   - 5-7 positions maximum at any time
   - 10-15% of portfolio per position
   - High conviction trades only

3. **Defined Risk/Reward**
   - Minimum 2:1 risk/reward ratio required
   - Hard stop-losses on every position (typically -15% to -20%)
   - Clear profit targets (typically +20% to +40%)

4. **Time-Limited Exposure**
   - Hold period: 2-8 weeks average
   - Exit before catalyst resolution (sell the rumor)
   - No long-term holds

### Trade Selection Criteria

**REQUIRED:**
- [ ] Specific catalyst with exact date
- [ ] Catalyst within 2-8 weeks
- [ ] Market cap $500M - $10B (sweet spot for momentum)
- [ ] Average daily volume >500K shares (liquidity requirement)
- [ ] Risk/Reward ratio ≥2:1
- [ ] Technical setup supporting directional bias

**PREFERRED:**
- High short interest (squeeze potential)
- Options activity showing institutional interest
- Recent insider buying
- Positive earnings momentum
- Sector tailwinds

**AVOID:**
- Micro-caps <$200M (too risky)
- Mega-caps >$50B (too slow)
- Heavily shorted without catalyst (fighting the trend)
- Penny stocks <$5 (high manipulation risk)
- Companies with upcoming dilution

### Catalyst Types (by Priority)

**Tier 1 - Highest Probability:**
1. **FDA PDUFA Decisions** (biotechnology)
   - Binary event, high volatility
   - Research Phase 3 trial results first
   - Check AdCom meeting outcomes
   - Approval rate: ~65% for PDUFA dates

2. **Earnings Surprises** (all sectors)
   - Focus on companies with positive pre-announcement history
   - Look for estimate revisions 2 weeks before
   - Options straddle prices indicate expected move

3. **Merger Arbitrage** (all sectors)
   - Deal spread >5% = opportunity
   - Check regulatory approval likelihood
   - Monitor antitrust concerns

**Tier 2 - Good Probability:**
4. **Product Launches** (tech, consumer)
   - Pre-order data available
   - Addressable market size
   - Competitive landscape analysis

5. **Clinical Trial Data Releases** (biotechnology)
   - Phase 2/3 readouts
   - KOL (Key Opinion Leader) conferences
   - Top-line data announcements

6. **Analyst Days / Investor Conferences**
   - Management guidance changes
   - New product announcements
   - Strategic pivots

**Tier 3 - Lower Probability:**
7. **Stock Splits / Buyback Announcements**
   - Historical correlation with price appreciation
   - Retail investor interest

8. **Index Rebalancing** (Russell, S&P)
   - Forced buying from index funds
   - Dates announced in advance

### Entry Tactics

**Timing:**
- Enter 2-4 weeks before catalyst (sweet spot)
- Too early = tie up capital, time decay
- Too late = already priced in, risk/reward deteriorates

**Order Types:**
- Use **limit orders** (don't chase)
- Set limit 1-2% above current price (OK to pay up slightly)
- If no fill after 1 hour, reassess thesis

**Position Building:**
- Start with 50% position
- Add second 50% on confirmation (technical breakout, news flow)
- Never average down on losing positions

### Exit Strategy

**Profit Targets:**
- **Target 1 (50% position):** +20% - take half off
- **Target 2 (remaining 50%):** +35% - exit completely
- **Moon shot scenario:** If position up >50%, trail stop at 25% below highs

**Stop-Loss Rules:**
- Set GTC (Good-Til-Canceled) stop immediately after entry
- Typical stop: -15% to -20% below entry
- **Never** move stop-loss lower (only higher as trade profits)
- If stopped out, accept loss and move on (no revenge trading)

**Time Stops:**
- Exit 1-2 days before catalyst announcement (sell the rumor)
- If catalyst delayed, exit after 2 weeks past original date
- If position flat after 4 weeks, exit and reallocate

**Catalyst Outcome Response:**
- **Positive outcome:** Sell 50% immediately (lock in gains), trail stop on rest
- **Negative outcome:** Exit immediately at market if stop not hit
- **Mixed outcome:** Exit 75%, evaluate new risk/reward on remainder

### Examples of SHORGAN Trades

**Example 1: SNDX - Successful FDA PDUFA Trade**
- Entry: $19.75 (14 days before PDUFA)
- Catalyst: Oct 25 FDA approval for Revuforj
- Stop-Loss: $16.50 (-16.5%)
- Target: $28.00 (+41.8%)
- Outcome: Approved, stock rallied to $27.50 (+39.2% gain)
- Exit: 50% at $25, 50% at $27.50 = +36% average gain

**Example 2: PLUG - Successful Short on Earnings Miss**
- Entry: SHORT $4.50 (3 weeks before earnings)
- Catalyst: Q3 earnings expected miss
- Stop-Loss: $5.25 (+16.7%)
- Target: $3.25 (-27.8%)
- Outcome: Missed earnings, stock fell to $3.50
- Exit: Covered short at $3.60 = +20% gain

**Example 3: Failed Trade - Stopped Out**
- Entry: $50.00
- Stop-Loss: $42.50 (-15%)
- Outcome: Stock dropped on unexpected negative news
- Exit: Stopped at $42.50 = -15% loss (controlled loss)

### Portfolio Characteristics

**Typical Portfolio Composition:**
- 3-5 long biotech catalyst trades (FDA approvals)
- 1-2 earnings momentum plays
- 0-1 short positions (sector weakness)
- 1-2 special situations (mergers, buyouts, spin-offs)

**Diversification Rules:**
- Max 40% in any single sector
- Max 30% in biotechnology (high binary risk)
- At least 2 different catalyst types represented

## DEE-BOT Strategy

### Strategy Name Origin
**DEE** = **D**efensive **E**quity **E**xposure (long-only, dividend-focused)

### Investment Thesis

   - Recession-resistant revenue streams

2. **Income Generation**
   - Minimum 2.5% dividend yield required
   - Dividend growth track record (5+ years)
   - Sustainable payout ratios (<75%)

3. **Beta Neutrality**
   - Target portfolio beta: 0.40-0.60
   - Lower volatility than S&P 500

1. **Utilities (40-50%)**
   - Electric utilities (regulated monopolies)
   - Water utilities (essential service)
   - Natural gas distribution
   - Examples: DUK, ED, NEE, SO, AEP

2. **Consumer Staples (20-30%)**
   - Food & beverage manufacturers
   - Household products
   - Tobacco (if acceptable to investor)
   - Examples: PEP, KO, PG, CL, CLX

**Acceptable Sectors (20-30% allocation):**

3. **Healthcare (10-15%)**
   - Large pharma with patent cliffs cleared
   - Medical device leaders
   - Healthcare REITs
   - Examples: JNJ, ABBV, MDT

4. **Telecommunications (5-10%)**

**Example DEE Portfolio:**
```
DUK (Duke Energy):        25% - Utility, 4.1% yield, Beta 0.35
ED (Con Edison):          30% - Utility, 3.8% yield, Beta 0.28
PEP (PepsiCo):            30% - Staples, 3.0% yield, Beta 0.62
Cash:                     15% - Rebalancing buffer

Weighted Avg Beta:        0.42 (defensive ✓)
Weighted Avg Yield:       3.5% (attractive ✓)
Utility Exposure:         55% (within limits ✓)
```

### Entry Tactics

**Timing:**
- Dollar-cost average over 2-4 weeks
- Buy on market weakness (>2% down days)
- Avoid buying at 52-week highs

**Valuation Discipline:**
- Don't overpay (use P/E relative to historical average)
- Dividend yield >3% preferred
- Price-to-book <2.5x for utilities

**Order Types:**
- Market orders acceptable (liquid large-caps)
- Can use limit orders 1% below current price

### Exit Strategy

**Hold Criteria:**
- Hold as long as:
  - [ ] Dividend maintained and growing
  - [ ] Fundamental story intact
  - [ ] Valuation reasonable
  - [ ] Beta remains <1.0

**Sell Triggers:**
1. **Dividend Cut Announced**
   - Immediate sell (strategy violation)
   - Rare but happens (e.g., GE 2018)

2. **Position Grows >40% of Portfolio**
   - Trim to 30% (take profits)
   - Rebalance into underweight positions

3. **Valuation Extreme**
   - P/E >30x (overvalued for defensive stock)
   - Dividend yield <2% (yield compression)

4. **Fundamental Deterioration**
   - Debt/Equity increasing rapidly
   - Free cash flow turning negative
   - Regulatory threats

5. **Better Alternative Available**
   - Can swap within sector
   - Must have significantly better metrics

**No Hard Stop-Losses:**
- Long-term strategy doesn't use stops
- Market volatility is noise, not signal
- Downturns are buying opportunities

### Rebalancing Strategy

**When to Rebalance:**
- Position drifts >15% from target weight
- Quarterly review minimum
- After significant market moves (>10%)

**How to Rebalance:**
1. Sell from overweight positions (trim winners)
2. Buy underweight positions (add to laggards)
3. Use dividends to buy underweight positions
4. Tax-loss harvesting in December

**Tax Efficiency:**
- Hold in taxable accounts (qualified dividends = 15-20% tax)
- Minimize turnover (long-term capital gains preferred)
- Rebalance using new contributions first

### Dividend Reinvestment

**DRIP Strategy:**
- Auto-reinvest dividends into same stock
- Exception: If position >35% of portfolio, take cash
- Use cash for rebalancing or new opportunities

**Income vs Growth Mode:**
- **Growth Mode (accumulation phase):** Reinvest all dividends
- **Income Mode (retirement):** Take dividends as cash

### Risk Management

**Portfolio-Level Risks:**
- **Interest Rate Risk:** Utilities sensitive to rising rates
  - Mitigation: Diversify into staples, limit duration
- **Inflation Risk:** Erodes fixed-income purchasing power
  - Mitigation: Choose companies with pricing power (PEP, PG)
- **Regulatory Risk:** Utilities subject to rate case decisions
  - Mitigation: Choose utilities with supportive regulators
- **Dividend Cut Risk:** Income stream interrupted
  - Mitigation: Screen for payout ratio <75%, FCF coverage

| Max leverage | 0% (no margin allowed) | Hard restriction |
| Cash minimum | 10% of portfolio | Don't deploy last 10% |

**Circuit Breakers:**

**Level 1 - Yellow Alert (Portfolio down 2% in one day):**
- Review all open positions
- Tighten stop-losses by 5%
- No new position entries until recovery

**Level 2 - Orange Alert (Portfolio down 3% in one day):**
- Exit all SHORGAN positions with losses >10%
- Move 25% of portfolio to cash
- Suspend new trades for 3 days

**Level 3 - Red Alert (Portfolio down 5% in one day):**
- Exit ALL SHORGAN positions immediately
- Keep only DEE positions
- Move to 50% cash
- Trading suspended for 1 week minimum

### Correlation Risk

**Monitor Cross-Strategy Correlation:**
- Target: SHORGAN and DEE should have correlation <0.5
- If correlation rises >0.7, strategies moving together (bad)
- Action: Increase diversification in SHORGAN

**Sector Exposure Limits (Combined):**
- Max 50% in any single sector across both portfolios
- Max 30% in high-risk sectors (biotech, small-cap)

---

## Position Sizing Rules

### SHORGAN-BOT Position Sizing

**Formula:**
```
Position Size = (Portfolio Value × Risk per Trade) / (Entry Price - Stop Price)

Example:
- Portfolio: $100,000
- Risk per trade: 1.5% = $1,500
- Entry: $20
- Stop: $17
- Position Size = ($100,000 × 0.015) / ($20 - $17) = 500 shares
- Dollar allocation = 500 × $20 = $10,000 (10% of portfolio)
```

**Risk Budget:**
- Risk 1-1.5% of portfolio per trade
- Never risk more than 2% on any single trade
- If stop-loss would risk >2%, reduce position size

**Conviction-Based Sizing:**
- **High conviction:** Full 15% position size
- **Medium conviction:** 10% position size
- **Low conviction:** 5% position size or skip trade

### DEE-BOT Position Sizing

**Equal-Weight Approach:**
```
Position Size = Portfolio Value / Number of Positions

Example:
- Portfolio: $100,000
- Target positions: 4
- Each position = $100,000 / 4 = $25,000
```

**Drift Tolerance:**
- Allow positions to drift ±15% from target weight
- Example: $25,000 position can drift to $21,250 - $28,750
- Rebalance when outside this range

**New Position Sizing:**
- Start with 50% of target allocation
- Add remaining 50% over 2-4 weeks (dollar-cost average)
- Final position at target weight

---

## Portfolio Rebalancing

### SHORGAN-BOT Rebalancing

**Not Applicable:** Active trading strategy doesn't rebalance
- Positions are closed based on catalyst resolution or stops
- New positions entered based on opportunity set
- Cash levels fluctuate based on active trade count

### DEE-BOT Rebalancing

**Quarterly Rebalancing Schedule:**
- Review: Last Friday of Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec
- Execute: First week of following month (Mon-Wed only)

**Rebalancing Triggers:**

**Trigger 1: Position Drift >15%**
```
Example:
- Target weight: 25% ($25K)
- Current value: $30K (position up 20%)
- Drift: ($30K - $25K) / $25K = 20% drift
- Action: Sell $5K to return to 25%
```

**Trigger 2: Sector Drift >10%**
```
Example:
- Target utilities: 50%
- Current utilities: 62%
- Drift: 12% over target
- Action: Trim utility positions, add staples
```

**Trigger 3: Market Crash (>10% down)**
- Emergency rebalance within 48 hours
- Sell bonds/cash to buy equities at discount
- Return to target weights

**Rebalancing Execution:**

**Tax-Aware Rebalancing:**
1. Check holding period (short-term vs long-term)
2. Prefer selling positions held >1 year (lower tax)
3. Harvest losses in December
4. Use new contributions before selling

**Order Sequencing:**
1. Place all sell orders first (generate cash)
2. Wait for settlement (T+2)
3. Place buy orders (deploy cash)
4. Verify all orders filled

**Minimize Transaction Costs:**
- Batch trades in same order
- Use limit orders to avoid spreads
- Trade during market hours (9:30-4:00 PM ET)
- Avoid first 30 min (high volatility)
