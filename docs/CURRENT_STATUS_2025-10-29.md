## ⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUES REQUIRING ATTENTION

### IMMEDIATE (Before 10 AM Thursday)

#### 1. API Key Rotation (CRITICAL - 10-15 minutes)
**Compromised Keys**:
- DEE-BOT: PK6FZK4DAQVTD7DYVH78
- SHORGAN-BOT: PKJRLSB2MFEJUSK6UK2E

**Steps**:
1. Log into https://app.alpaca.markets/
2. Settings → API Keys
3. Delete old keys (both DEE and SHORGAN)
4. Generate new key pairs
5. Update .env file with new credentials
6. Test: `python scripts/automation/daily_claude_research.py --help`

**Impact if Not Done**: Keys are exposed in Git history, potential unauthorized access

---

### 2. Multi-Agent Approval Rate Monitoring (8:35 AM Thursday)

**Current State**: Unknown (last test showed 0% approval)
**Previous State**: 100% approval (rubber-stamping)
**Target State**: 60-80% approval

**What to Check**:
```bash
# At 8:35 AM, review the generated trades file:
cat docs/TODAYS_TRADES_2025-10-30.md

# Look for:
# - Total trades proposed
# - Total trades approved
# - Approval rate percentage
```

**Action Based on Results**:
- **If 0% approved**: Threshold too high, needs adjustment (0.65 → 0.60)
- **If 100% approved**: Validation broken, consider external-only mode
- **If 60-80% approved**: Perfect! System working correctly
- **If 20-60% approved**: Acceptable, monitor for a few days

**File to Edit** (if needed): `scripts/automation/generate_todays_trades_v2.py`
- Look for `APPROVAL_THRESHOLD = 0.55` or similar
- Adjust based on observed behavior

---

## 🔧 SHORT-TERM PRIORITIES (This Week)

### Priority 1: Stop Loss Automation (6 hours)
**Status**: Script may exist (`set_stop_losses.py`), needs enhancement

**Requirements**:
- Hard stops: -12% DEE-BOT, -15% SHORGAN-BOT
- Trailing stops: After +10% gain
- Auto-adjustment: Daily at 4:00 PM
- Monitoring: Hourly checks during market hours

**Implementation**:
1. Review existing `scripts/automation/set_stop_losses.py`
2. Add monitoring and auto-adjustment logic
3. Add trailing stop functionality
4. Schedule in Task Scheduler (hourly 9:30 AM - 3:30 PM)
5. Test with paper accounts first

**Expected Impact**: Reduce max drawdown, protect profits

---

### Priority 2: Test Collection Errors (3 hours)
**Status**: 11 test files failing with collection errors

**Likely Issues**:
- Import path problems (old src/ vs new structure)
- Missing mocks for Alpaca/Anthropic APIs
- Outdated fixtures or test data
- Removed/renamed modules

**Fix Approach**:
```bash
# Identify failing tests
pytest --collect-only 2>&1 | grep ERROR

# Fix imports one by one
# Update mocks
# Remove obsolete tests

# Target: 100% test collection success
pytest --collect-only
```

**Expected Impact**: Enable full test suite, improve code quality

---

### Priority 3: Profit-Taking Manager Scheduling (1 hour)
**Status**: Script exists (`manage_profit_taking.py`), not scheduled

**Implementation**:
1. Test script manually:
   ```bash
   python scripts/automation/manage_profit_taking.py
   ```
2. Add to Task Scheduler:
   - Name: "AI Trading - Profit Taking"
   - Schedule: Hourly, 9:30 AM - 3:30 PM, weekdays
   - Command: Same as above
3. Monitor effectiveness over 1 week
4. Adjust levels if needed (currently 50% @ +20%, 25% @ +30%)

**Expected Impact**: Lock in gains, reduce give-backs

---

## 🎓 LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well
1. **Deep Research Quality**: Claude Opus 4.1 with extended thinking produces excellent 400-600 line comprehensive reports
2. **Security Response**: Rapid identification and remediation of hardcoded keys with full documentation
3. **Systematic Debugging**: Verbose logging revealed multi-agent validation issue clearly
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive session summaries enable continuity

### What Needs Improvement
1. **Multi-Agent Calibration**: Went from 100% approval (too lenient) to 0% approval (too strict)
2. **Testing Coverage**: 36% coverage insufficient, 11 collection errors blocking full suite
3. **Stop Loss Automation**: Still manual, needs automated monitoring and adjustment
4. **Monitoring Gaps**: No alerts for anomalies (approval rate, system health, task failures)

### Process Improvements Implemented
1. **Documentation Cleanup**: Archived old sessions and obsolete docs
2. **Security Best Practices**: Environment variables, incident documentation
3. **Structured Analysis**: Repository review with ratings and prioritization
4. **Backtest Framework**: Quantitative impact measurement for improvements

## 🚨 RISK ASSESSMENT

### Current Risks (As of Oct 29 Evening)

**CRITICAL Risks**:
1. **Compromised API Keys** - Fixed in code, rotation pending
   - Mitigation: User must rotate keys tomorrow
   - Impact: Medium (paper accounts, but security violation)

**HIGH Risks**:
2. **Multi-Agent Over-Filtering** - May reject all trades (0% approval)
   - Mitigation: Monitor tomorrow, adjust threshold if needed
   - Impact: High (no trading = no returns)

3. **No Stop Loss Automation** - Manual intervention required
   - Mitigation: Implement this week (6 hours)
   - Impact: High (unprotected losses possible)

**MEDIUM Risks**:
4. **Test Suite Degraded** - 11 collection errors
   - Mitigation: Fix this week (3 hours)
   - Impact: Medium (can't validate changes fully)

5. **Poor Backtest Performance** - -0.32% return, -0.58 Sharpe
   - Mitigation: Implement improvements (stops, profit-taking)
   - Impact: Medium (strategy may not be profitable)

**LOW Risks**:
6. **Concentration Risk** - DEE-BOT 31% in MRK
   - Mitigation: Tomorrow's trades include rebalancing
   - Impact: Low (paper account, trade execution tomorrow)

7. **Cash Drag** - SHORGAN 74% cash uninvested
   - Mitigation: Tomorrow's trades deploy capital
   - Impact: Low (opportunity cost, not loss)
