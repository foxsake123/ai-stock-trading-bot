## 📊 PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS

### Backtest Results Summary
```
Initial Simple Backtest (March 27 - September 23, 2025):
├── Tickers Tested: AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL
├── Initial Capital: $100,000
├── Final Value: $100,000 (0.00% return)
├── Total Trades: 0
└── Issue Identified: Strategy parameters too conservative

Root Cause Analysis:
