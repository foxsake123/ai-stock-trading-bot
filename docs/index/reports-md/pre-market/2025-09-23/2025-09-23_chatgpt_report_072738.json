Short idea.\n\n(3) Options Overlays\n\nSRRK: Oct $30 calls (lottery ticket).\n\nFBIO: Nov $5/$8 bull call spread.\n\nRIVN: Oct $20/$25 bull spread.\n\nIONQ: Oct $60/$45 bear put spread.\n\nKSS: Nov $20 long call, financed by selling Oct $25 call (diagonal).\n\n(4) Order Sizing & Stop Management\n\nAllocate 4-6% per binary biotech (SRRK, FBIO).\n\n8-10% for RIVN (trend + catalyst).\n\n3-5% for KSS.\n\n5% for IONQ short/puts.\n\nStop losses: \u221220% equity for biotechs, \u221212-15% for consumer/EV, buy-stop for short.\n\n(5) Summary Table\nTicker\tCatalyst\tPosition\tEntry\tStop\tTarget\tOptions Overlay\tSizing\tProfit-Taking\nSRRK\tFDA SMA decision Sep 23\tLong\tmkt ~ $34\t$27\t$45\tOct $30 calls\t5%\tExit same day if +50%\nFBIO\tFDA CUTX-101 Sep 30\tLong\tmkt ~ $4.10\t$3.00\t$6.00\tNov $5/$8 bull spread\t6%\tTrim +50%, exit on news\nRIVN\tQ3 deliveries early Oct\tLong\tmkt ~ $15.3\t$13.0\t$20\tOct $20/$25 bull spread\t10%\tScale out >$18\nIONQ\tOverbought, no catalyst\tShort\tmkt ~ $60\tbuy-stop $69\t$45\tOct $60/$45 put spread\t5%\tCover 25% gain\nKSS\tHoliday/activist\tLong\tmkt ~ $17\t$15\t$22\tNov $20 call / short Oct $25\t4%\tTrim at +20%\n(6) Portfolio Holdings \u2013 Updates\n\nBTBT, BYND, EMBC: monitor, but no new catalysts\u2014hold.\n\nINCY: catalyst (Opzelura) played out; consider trimming into strength.\n\nNCNO short: keep as hedge, trend intact.\n\nRGTI: already doubled; trail stops tighter.\n\nSRRK, FBIO, RIVN: remain core catalyst positions; size increases justified.\n\n\ud83d\udd11 Thesis Review Summary (Week Ahead):\nThis week is dominated by biotech FDA catalysts (SRRK today, FBIO next week). EV momentum (RIVN) and retail consumer catalysts (KSS) provide diversification. A tactical short in IONQ hedges exuberance in quantum/AI. Expect high volatility; stop discipline is critical.
