### Rebalancing Trades (Market Orders for Speed):

**SELL Orders (Trim Overweight)**:

   Current: 64 → Target: 28 (keeps $8,485 position)

   Current: 220 → Target: 100 (keeps $8,432 position)

```

**Total Invested**: $11,765

**Net Cash Impact**: +$70,302 (eliminates negative balance, adds buffer)

**Final Expected State**:
- Cash: ~$-7,273 → STILL NEGATIVE but much improved

**REVISED PLAN - Sell More to Get Positive Cash**:
```
Additional Sell:
14. UNH: Sell 2 more shares @ market ($358) → Raise $716
15. PG: Sell 4 more shares @ market ($149) → Raise $596
16. KO: Sell 10 more shares @ market ($68) → Raise $680
```

**Revised Net Cash**: +$71,994 → **Final Cash: ~$-5,581 (STILL SHORT)**

**FINAL SOLUTION - Skip WMT/JNJ for now**:
Just trim overweight positions to raise cash above zero. No new positions.
