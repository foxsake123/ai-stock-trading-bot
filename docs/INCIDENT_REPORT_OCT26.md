# Incident Report: October 26, 2025
**Type**: Stale Order Execution
**Severity**: Low (Paper Trading)
**Status**: Resolved

---

## What Happened

At 3:00 PM ET on Saturday, October 26, 2025, the execution script was run manually and executed trades from October 8, 2025 (18 days old) instead of current date trades.

### Execution Details

**Trades Executed** (from Oct 8 file):
- 5 DEE-BOT orders (WMT, UNH, NEE, COST, MRK)
- 4 SHORGAN-BOT orders (ARQT, HIMS, WOLF, PLUG short)
- All 9 orders placed as limit orders
- All orders "accepted" but not filled (market closed)

**Stop-Loss Attempts**:
- 4 stop-loss orders attempted
- All 4 failed: "potential wash trade detected. use complex orders"
- This is expected behavior for Alpaca's wash trade protection

### Impact

**Financial Impact**: NONE
- Paper trading account (no real money)
- Orders never filled (market closed on Saturday)
- All 9 orders cancelled successfully at 3:05 PM ET

**Portfolio Status**:
- Total Value: $206,494.82 (+3.25% / +$6,494.82)
- No positions affected
- No executed trades

---

## Root Cause

1. **No current trades file**: No `TODAYS_TRADES_2025-10-26.md` exists
2. **Manual execution**: Script run manually on Saturday (automation would run Monday)
3. **Stale file fallback**: Script likely defaulted to most recent trades file (Oct 8)
4. **Market closed**: Saturday execution prevented fills

---

## Resolution

### Immediate Actions Taken ✅
1. Cancelled all 9 open orders (3:05 PM ET)
2. Verified portfolio status (no impact)
3. Documented incident

### Preventive Actions

**Before Monday, October 28**:
1. Generate fresh research (Saturday 12 PM schedule now active)
2. Generate trades from research (Monday 8:30 AM automation)
3. Let automation run on schedule (Monday 9:30 AM execution)

**System Improvements Needed**:
1. Add date validation to execution script (reject trades older than 1 day)
2. Add market hours check with hard stop (no execution if market closed)
3. Require explicit --force flag for manual execution
4. Add "Are you sure?" confirmation for manual runs

---

## Lessons Learned

1. **Automation schedule is correct**: Saturday 12 PM research → Monday 8:30 AM trades → Monday 9:30 AM execution
2. **Manual execution is risky**: Should only be used with explicit date parameter
3. **Paper trading saved us**: No financial impact due to paper account
4. **Market closed protection works**: Orders accepted but never filled on closed market

## Recommended Changes

### High Priority (Before Monday)
- [ ] Update execution script with date validation
- [ ] Add market hours hard stop
- [ ] Require --force flag for manual execution

### Medium Priority (This Week)
- [ ] Add "Are you sure?" prompt for manual runs
- [ ] Add file age check (reject >24 hour old trades files)
- [ ] Improve error messages when no current trades file exists

### Low Priority (Optional)
- [ ] Add Telegram notifications for execution events
- [ ] Create dashboard showing next scheduled run times
- [ ] Add audit log for all manual interventions

## Status: RESOLVED ✅

**Next Actions**:
1. Wait for Saturday 12 PM research generation (automated)
2. Verify research files created
3. Let Monday automation run normally
4. Monitor Monday execution for proper operation

**Incident Closed**: October 26, 2025, 3:10 PM ET
**No Further Action Required**
