**Issue**: Initially thought trades were for Oct 8, actually for Oct 7 (TODAY)
**Resolution**: Urgent Telegram notification sent, orders executed immediately

### 2. DEE-BOT Negative Cash Balance
**Issue**: Cash balance -$9,521.89, violating LONG-ONLY strategy

- Canceled all pending DEE orders
- Sold CVX ($4,772) and PEP ($9,817)
- Restored positive balance: $5,052.41 ✅

### 3. PLUG Short Unavailable

**Resolution**: Adjusted limit to $56.59, filled at $55.97 (success)

2. **Monitor cash balances** - DEE-BOT was using margin, violated LONG-ONLY
3. **Limit price flexibility** - HIMS adjustment saved the order from not filling
4. **Stop-loss timing** - Need to wait for wash trade detection window
5. **Short availability** - Not all stocks are available for shorting (PLUG)
