**SHORGAN-BOT Analysis**:
- **Root Cause**: Yesterday's (Oct 7) trades created wash sale conflicts
- **Wash Sale Rule**: Cannot buy/sell same security within 30 days if selling at loss
- **Error Type**: Platform correctly prevented wash sales
- **Impact**: No new catalyst positions added today

## Wash Sale Analysis

### What is a Wash Sale?

A wash sale occurs when you:
1. Sell a security at a loss
2. Purchase the same (or substantially identical) security within 30 days before or after the sale

**IRS Rule**: The loss is disallowed and must be added to the cost basis of the new purchase.

### Why Orders Failed Today

**Problem**: Yesterday (Oct 7), we purchased ARQT, HIMS, and WOLF. Today's orders attempted to buy the **exact same securities** again.

**Platform Protection**: Alpaca detected potential wash sales and blocked the orders with error: "potential wash trade detected. use complex orders"

**Timeline**:
- **Oct 7, 2025**: Bought ARQT (150), HIMS (37), WOLF (96)
- **Oct 8, 2025**: Attempted to buy same securities again ❌
- **Earliest Re-entry**: Nov 6, 2025 (30 days after Oct 7)

### Lessons Learned

1. **Order Coordination Issue**: Two consecutive days had overlapping positions
2. **Research Timing**: ChatGPT research appears to have recommended same stocks 2 days in a row
3. **Position Tracking**: Need better cross-day position tracking before order generation
4. **Platform Limits**: Alpaca correctly enforces wash sale rules

### Resolution Strategy

**Short Term**:
- Keep existing Oct 7 positions (ARQT, HIMS, WOLF) with active stops
- Monitor catalysts (ARQT FDA Oct 13, WOLF delisting Oct 10)
- No new SHORGAN orders until wash sale period clears

**Long Term**:
- Add wash sale checking to order generation pipeline
- Cross-reference yesterday's trades before generating today's orders
- Consider position sizing adjustments to avoid overlap

## Stop-Loss Order Status

### Existing Stop-Loss Orders (from Oct 7)

All 3 GTC stop-loss orders from yesterday remain active:

| Symbol | Quantity | Stop Price | Protection | Status |
|--------|----------|------------|------------|--------|
| ARQT | 150 | $16.50 | -17.5% | ✅ ACTIVE (GTC) |
| HIMS | 37 | $49.00 | -12.5% | ✅ ACTIVE (GTC) |
| WOLF | 96 | $22.00 | -15.4% | ✅ ACTIVE (GTC) |

**Risk Protection**:
- Max loss if all stops hit: $1,158 (0.56% of portfolio)
- Total capital protected: $7,512
- All orders Good-Til-Cancelled (GTC)

### New Stop-Loss Orders (DEE-BOT)

**Note**: DEE-BOT typically does not use stop-loss orders (long-only, buy-and-hold strategy). These 5 new positions are held for strategic rebalancing, not active trading.

**DEE-BOT Risk Management**:
- Strategy: Long-term defensive holdings
- Stops: Not typically used (structural positions)
- Review: Quarterly rebalancing based on fundamentals
