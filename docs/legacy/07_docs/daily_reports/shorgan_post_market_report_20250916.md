2. **Sept 19 (Thursday):** **Incyte (INCY) FDA decision** on Opzelura’s pediatric indication.  We hold 61 shares at $83.97 with stop $80.61 and target $92【843629838163067†L61-L68】.
3. **Sept 22 (Monday next week):** **Scholar Rock (SRRK) PDUFA**.  No position currently due to wash‑trade restriction【809346071827561†L9-L11】; monitor for re‑entry opportunities.  
4. **Early October:** **Rivian (RIVN) Q3 deliveries** – remain long; watch for production and R2 SUV updates【809346071827561†L50-L54】.
5. **Daily tasks:** Run morning pipeline for new opportunities, review overnight gaps, and adjust stops as needed【809346071827561†L135-L142】.
