# Trading Session Report - September 18, 2025

## Session Overview
**Date**: September 18, 2025
**Time**: 8:00 AM - 10:00 AM ET
**Primary Focus**: Morning trade execution and ChatGPT extension fix

---

## 1. Morning Trade Execution (9:30 AM)

### Trades Executed Successfully
| Symbol | Action | Shares | Reason | Result |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| CBRL | SELL | 81 | Earnings miss (-10% AH) | ✅ Executed |
| RGTI | SELL | 65 | Profit taking (+22.7%) | ✅ Executed |
| ORCL | SELL | 21 | Profit taking (+21.9%) | ✅ Executed |

### Technical Challenge Resolved
- **Issue**: Alpaca API showed "insufficient qty available: 0"
- **Root Cause**: All positions had active stop-loss orders locking shares
- **Solution**: Cancelled stop orders, executed trades, then reset stops

### Stop Orders Reset
- **KSS**: 90 shares @ $15.18 stop
- **INCY**: 61 shares @ $77.25 stop (FDA decision Sept 19)
- **RGTI**: 65 shares @ $17.35 stop (remaining half)
- **ORCL**: 21 shares @ $268.66 stop (remaining half)

## 2. ChatGPT Extension Fix

### Problem Identified
- Extension failing with "could not convert string to float: '.'"
- Server path mismatch (old structure vs new)
- Parser not handling ChatGPT table format correctly

### Solution Implemented
1. **Created new server** (`chatgpt_report_server_fixed.py`):
   - Updated paths to `scripts-and-data/daily-json/chatgpt/`
   - Enhanced table parsing for markdown format
   - Added try-catch blocks for float conversion
   - Better regex patterns: `\$?(\d+\.?\d*)` instead of `\$?([\d.]+)`

2. **Updated Chrome extension**:
   - Enhanced table extraction for TradingAgents format
   - Better visual indicators (green/red status)
   - Auto-detection every 10 seconds

### Results
- ✅ Successfully extracted 6 trades from ChatGPT
- ✅ Server running stable on localhost:8888
- ✅ Reports saving to correct directory
