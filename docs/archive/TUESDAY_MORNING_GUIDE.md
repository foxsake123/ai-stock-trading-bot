## 🔍 MONITORING DURING EXECUTION

### Watch for:

   - "[VALIDATION FAILED]" - Trade blocked for safety
   - "[ADJUSTED]" - Position size auto-corrected
   - "[RETRY]" - Failed trade retrying

2. **Success Indicators**
   - "[SUCCESS] Order ID: xxx" - Trade executed
   - "[OK]" messages - Systems working

3. **Warning Signs**
   - Multiple "[FAIL]" - Check API connection
   - "Insufficient buying power" - Normal, will adjust

## 📈 POST-EXECUTION REVIEW (10:00 AM)

### Check Results:
```bash

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "No trades file found"
```bash
python scripts-and-data/automation/generate_todays_trades.py
```

### Issue: "Market is closed"
- Wait until 9:30 AM ET
- Market closed = validation working correctly

### Issue: "Insufficient buying power"
- System will auto-reduce position size
- No action needed

### Issue: Multiple failures
```bash
# Test connection
python scripts-and-data/automation/test_full_pipeline.py

# Check API
python -c "import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi; print('API OK')"
```

## 📝 NOTES

### What's New:
1. **Pre-execution validation** prevents errors
2. **Auto-retry** recovers from failures
3. **Position sizing** adjusts automatically
4. **Margin prevention** keeps DEE-BOT cash-only
5. **Fallback generation** creates trades if missing

### Expected Behavior:
- Some trades may show "[ADJUSTED]" - this is good
- Retries are normal and automatic
- Validation may block some trades for safety
- System will maximize successful executions
