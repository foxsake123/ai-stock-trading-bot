# Tuesday September 30, 2025 - Trading Day Checklist
## Pre-Market Preparation & Execution Guide

---

## 🌅 PRE-MARKET CHECKLIST (Before 9:30 AM)

### 1. System Status Check (9:00 AM)
```bash
# Quick system status
python scripts-and-data/automation/system_dashboard.py --quick

# Or full dashboard
python scripts-and-data/automation/system_dashboard.py
```

### 2. Verify Automated Tasks
- [ ] Check if TODAYS_TRADES file was generated
- [ ] Verify Windows Task Scheduler is running
- [ ] Confirm Alpaca API connection

**If Tasks Not Configured:**
```bash
# Run as Administrator
scripts-and-data/automation/setup_all_tasks.bat
```

### 3. Review Today's Trades
Check `docs/TODAYS_TRADES_2025-09-30.md` for:
- DEE-BOT defensive positions
- SHORGAN-BOT catalyst plays
- Total number of trades
- Position sizes within limits

---

## 🚀 MARKET HOURS (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM)

### 9:30 AM - Automated Execution
The system will automatically:
1. ✅ Load today's trades file (or generate if missing)
2. ✅ Validate each trade before execution
3. ✅ Adjust position sizes to fit limits
4. ✅ Prevent margin usage for DEE-BOT
5. ✅ Retry failed trades with adjusted parameters
6. ✅ Log all execution results

**Monitor Execution:**
```bash
# Watch execution in real-time
tail -f scripts-and-data/trade-logs/daily_execution_*.json
```

### Expected Improvements from Yesterday
- **Success Rate**: 56% → 85%+ (validation layer added)
- **Manual Work**: Eliminated (automated trade generation)
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic (retry mechanism)
- **Position Sizing**: Auto-corrected (validation checks)

### 10:00 AM - Post-Execution Review
Check execution results:
```bash
# View execution summary
python scripts-and-data/automation/test_full_pipeline.py
```

Look for:
- Number of successful trades
- Any failed trades and reasons
- Position size adjustments made
- Margin prevention activations

python scripts-and-data/automation/generate_todays_trades.py
```

### Issue 2: "Insufficient buying power"
**Fix:** Validation layer will auto-reduce position sizes
