# Session Summary - January 6, 2026
## Railway Deployment & Live Threshold Fix

---

## Session Overview
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Focus**: Railway cloud deployment, live account threshold fix, trade execution
**Status**: Complete

---

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Railway Deployment - Always-On Scheduler
**Problem**: Railway doesn't have a "Cron" option in settings
**Solution**: Created `railway_scheduler.py` - an always-on service that handles scheduling internally

**Files Created/Modified**:
- `railway_scheduler.py` (NEW) - Always-on scheduler using Python's `schedule` library
- `Procfile` - Changed to `web: python railway_scheduler.py`
- `requirements.txt` - Added `schedule>=1.2.0`

**Schedule (ET)**:
- Saturday 12:00 PM: Research generation
- Mon-Fri 8:30 AM: Trade generation
- Mon-Fri 9:30 AM: Trade execution
- Mon-Fri 4:30 PM: Performance graph

### 2. Live Account Threshold Fix
**Problem**: SHORGAN Live getting 0% approval rate
- All trades had 56% confidence (70% external + 23% internal agents)
- Live threshold was 65%, causing all trades to be rejected

**Solution**: Lowered live threshold from 65% → 55% (same as paper accounts)

**File Modified**: `scripts/automation/generate_todays_trades_v2.py`
- Line 743: `APPROVAL_THRESHOLD = 0.55`

**Result**: SHORGAN Live now 7/8 approved (87.5%)
