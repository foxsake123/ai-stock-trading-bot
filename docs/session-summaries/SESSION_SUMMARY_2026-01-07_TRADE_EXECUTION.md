## Session Overview
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Focus**: Execute Wednesday trades, fix SHORGAN Live parser issue, manual buy order placement

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Trade Generation Check
- Verified trades ran at 8:34 AM (Railway automation working)
- DEE-BOT: 4 trades generated
- SHORGAN Paper: 13 trades generated
- SHORGAN Live: **0 trades extracted** (parser issue)

### 2. SHORGAN Live Parser Issue
**Problem**: Parser failed to extract trades from research file
- Research file had trades in code block format
- Parser regex didn't recognize the format
- Error: "No external recommendations found for SHORGAN-BOT"

**Workaround**: Manually created `docs/TODAYS_TRADES_2026-01-07_SHORGAN_LIVE.md` with 7 trades extracted from research:
- 5 SELLS: NCNO, RIVN, SOFI, ROKU, BEAM
- 2 BUYS: PLUG, LCID

## Issues Identified

### 1. Parser Issue (report_parser.py)
**Problem**: SHORGAN Live research uses code block format that parser doesn't recognize:
```
Action: sell
Ticker: NCNO
Shares: 11
Total proceeds: $269.06
```

**Current Format Expected**: Different markdown table or structured format

**Fix Needed**: Update parser regex to handle code block trade format

### 2. debate_logger Attribute Error
**Error**: `'AutomatedTradeGeneratorV2' object has no attribute 'debate_logger'`
**Impact**: Minor - doesn't block trade generation
**Priority**: Low

### 3. yfinance Data Failures
**Error**: All tickers showing "No price data found, symbol may be delisted"
**Impact**: Using fallback pricing methods
**Priority**: Low (not blocking trades)

---

## Railway Deployment Status
- Deployed successfully (user ran `railway up`)
- First automated run: 8:34 AM - trades generated
- Scheduler appears to be working

---

## Next Steps
1. **4:30 PM**: Run performance graph
2. **Fix parser**: Update report_parser.py to handle code block format
3. **Monitor Railway**: Verify Thursday 8:30 AM automation
