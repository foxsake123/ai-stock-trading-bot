- DEE-BOT: Portfolio rebalancing recommendations
- SHORGAN Paper: 11 catalyst-driven trades
- SHORGAN Live: 8 small-account trades
- All PDFs sent to Telegram

### 2. Trade Execution - 22 Total Trades

### 3. New Script Created: `execute_shorgan_paper.py`

**Problem**: Main `execute_daily_trades.py` routes all SHORGAN trades to LIVE account
**Solution**: Created dedicated script for SHORGAN Paper account

```python
# scripts/automation/execute_shorgan_paper.py
# Uses SHORGAN Paper API credentials:
# - ALPACA_API_KEY_SHORGAN
# - ALPACA_SECRET_KEY_SHORGAN
# - Base URL: https://paper-api.alpaca.markets
```

Features:
- Parses SHORGAN-BOT section from TODAYS_TRADES markdown
- Validates positions before selling
- Adjusts order sizes based on buying power
- Logs all trades to `scripts-and-data/trade-logs/`

### 4. Lockup Expiration Feature Added

Added IPO/SPAC lockup expiration as catalyst screening criteria:

**SHORGAN Paper Prompt Updates:**
- CATALYST CALENDAR: Added lockup expiration (7-30 day window)
- SHORT OPPORTUNITIES: Added detailed lockup short criteria

**SHORGAN Live Prompt Updates:**
- CATALYST CALENDAR: Added lockup screening for $10-$100 stocks
- SHORT SELLING RULES: Added sizing guidance ($150-$250 per lockup short)

**Rationale**: Lockup expirations create predictable selling pressure from insiders, making them high-probability short setups when combined with overvalued stocks trading above IPO price.
