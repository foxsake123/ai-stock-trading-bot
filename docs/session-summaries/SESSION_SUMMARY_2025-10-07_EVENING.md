## Part 1: Trading Execution (9:30 AM - 10:35 AM)

### Critical Issues Discovered

**1. Date Confusion (RESOLVED)**
- Initial belief: Trades for Oct 8, 2025

- User correction: "Market opens at 9:30 AM ET TODAY"
- Action: Urgent Telegram notification + immediate execution

**2. DEE-BOT Negative Cash Balance (RESOLVED)**
- Problem: Cash balance -$9,521.89 (using margin)
- Violation: LONG-ONLY strategy constraint
- Solution: Canceled 5 pending orders, sold CVX ($4,772) + PEP ($9,817)
- Result: Cash restored to +$5,052.41 ✅

**3. HIMS Market Deviation (RESOLVED)**
- Problem: Market $56.03 vs limit $54.00 (3.8% above)
- Risk: Order unlikely to fill
- Solution: Adjusted limit to $56.59 (market + 1% buffer)
- Result: Filled at $55.97 (saved $0.62) ✅
