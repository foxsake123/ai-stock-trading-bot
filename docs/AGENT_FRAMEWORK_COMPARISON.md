**Bias System:**
- Not strategy-specific
- Unified decision process
- Bull/Bear debate provides natural balance

---

### Our System

**Explicit Strategy-Specific Weighting:**

**DEE-BOT (Defensive Strategy):**
```python
{
    'fundamental': 0.25,  # Highest - quality focus
    'technical': 0.15,
    'sentiment': 0.10,
    'news': 0.10,
    'risk': 0.20,         # Second highest - defensive
    'bull': 0.05,
    'bear': 0.10,         # Higher bear weight (cautious)
    'alternative': 0.05
}
```

**SHORGAN-BOT (Aggressive Catalyst Strategy):**
```python
{
    'fundamental': 0.10,
    'technical': 0.15,
    'sentiment': 0.15,    # Higher - momentum focus
    'news': 0.15,         # Higher - catalyst focus
    'risk': 0.10,
    'bull': 0.15,         # Higher - aggressive
    'bear': 0.05,
    'alternative': 0.15   # Highest - insider/options flow
}
```

**Bias Characteristics:**
- Mathematically explicit
- Strategy-aligned
- Tunable per trading style
- Transparent scoring

## 6. Consensus Mechanisms

### TauricResearch: Hierarchical Approval

**Process:**

3. Trader synthesizes consensus
4. Portfolio Manager makes final call

**Strengths:**
- Clear accountability (Portfolio Manager)
- Structured debate ensures all perspectives heard
- Human-like firm hierarchy
- Natural conflict resolution

**Weaknesses:**
- Single point of failure (PM rejection kills trade)
- Slower (sequential processing)
- Potential for PM bias to dominate

---

### Our System: Weighted Democratic Voting

**Process:**
1. All 8 agents analyze in parallel
2. Each agent scores 0-100
3. Weighted average calculated per strategy
4. Must exceed 70% threshold
5. Auto-execute if consensus reached

**Strengths:**
- Fast (parallel processing)
- Transparent (mathematical scoring)
- Strategy-specific optimization
- No single point of failure

**Weaknesses:**
- No explicit "debate" mechanism
- Could miss nuanced trade-offs
- Threshold tuning required
- Less human-interpretable

   - Debate output adjusts final score ±10%
   - Hybrid approach: fast parallel + deep debate when needed

### Medium-Term (This Month)
3. **Refactor to LangGraph Architecture**:
   - Improve modularity
   - Enable easy LLM swapping
   - Better state management
   - Keep our weighting system

4. **Add Multi-LLM Strategy**:

   - Deep model (Claude Opus) for final validation
   - Cost optimization + quality boost

### Long-Term (This Quarter)
5. **Build Decision Audit System**:
   - Log all agent reasoning
   - Track consensus evolution
   - Backtestable decision history
   - Regulatory compliance ready

6. **Create Portfolio Manager Override**:
