# 🤖 AI Stock Trading Bot - System Overview

## What This System Does

This is a **fully automated AI-powered trading system** that:
1. **Identifies trading opportunities** using catalyst events (earnings, FDA approvals, product launches)
2. **Makes trading decisions** using 7 specialized AI agents working together
3. **Executes trades automatically** with built-in risk management
4. **Tracks performance** with real-time dashboards and analytics

## Core Components

### 1. 🧠 **Multi-Agent AI System**
Seven specialized agents collaborate to make trading decisions:

- **Fundamental Analyst** - Evaluates company financials and valuations
- **Technical Analyst** - Analyzes price patterns and indicators (RSI, MACD)
- **News Analyst** - Monitors breaking news and market sentiment
- **Sentiment Analyst** - Tracks social media and retail sentiment
- **Bull Researcher** - Identifies positive catalysts and opportunities
- **Bear Researcher** - Identifies risks and provides counterarguments
- **Risk Manager** - Has veto power over risky trades

### 2. 📅 **Catalyst-Driven Trading**
Focuses on specific events within 30 days:

- **Earnings Releases** (e.g., ORCL on 9/12, ADBE on 9/14)
- **FDA Decisions** (e.g., SAVA Phase 3 data on 9/15)
- **Product Launches** (e.g., AAPL iPhone 16 on 9/15)
- **Economic Events** (e.g., FOMC meeting on 9/18)
- **Options Expiration** plays

### 3. 📊 **Market Data Integration**
Real-time data from multiple sources:

- **Yahoo Finance** - Live quotes and technical indicators
- **Options Data** - Implied volatility and options chains
- **News Feeds** - Breaking news and sentiment analysis
- **Alternative Data** - Social media sentiment (when configured)

### 4. 🎯 **Automated Execution**
Handles the complete trading lifecycle:

- **Signal Generation** - Creates trade signals from catalyst analysis
- **Risk Validation** - Checks position sizes and exposure limits
- **Order Execution** - Places orders with stop loss and take profit
- **Position Monitoring** - Tracks P&L and manages positions

### 5. 📈 **Performance Tracking**
Comprehensive analytics and reporting:

- **Portfolio Metrics** - Total return, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown
- **Trade Analytics** - Win rate, average P&L, performance by catalyst
- **Risk Monitoring** - Exposure tracking, loss limits, position sizing
- **System Health** - Uptime, data feed status, execution success rate
