## PROBLEM STATEMENT

### Critical Issues Identified

1. **DEE-BOT Cash Crisis**
   - Current cash: **-$5,143.84** (NEGATIVE - on margin)
   - Pending orders: **$23,935** (will worsen margin)
   - Risk: Margin call, forced liquidation, strategy violation (should be cash-only)

2. **Cross-Bot Position Conflict**
   - DEE-BOT: Long PG position (160 shares, $24,355)
   - SHORGAN-BOT: Short PG position (-132 shares, -$20,093)
   - Net exposure confusion and unnecessary complexity

3. **Portfolio Optimization Needed**
   - DEE-BOT: Over-concentrated in tech (38%)
   - DEE-BOT: Missing healthcare, industrials exposure
   - SHORGAN-BOT: Too many small positions (17 longs)
   - SHORGAN-BOT: No stop losses on profitable shorts
