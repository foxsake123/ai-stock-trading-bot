- **Entry Price**: $19.75 (market order at open)
- **Position Size**: 506 shares ($10,000 allocation)
- **Stop-Loss**: $16.50 (-16.5% max loss = $1,645)
- **Price Target**: $28.00 (+41.8% gain = $4,177)
- **Time Horizon**: 12 days

- **Time Horizon**: 3 days (delisting deadline)

**Catalyst:**
- **Event**: Nasdaq delisting warning - must regain $1.00 compliance by October 10

## Appendix: Calculation Methodologies

<!--
Transparency in how we calculate key metrics.
-->

**Position Sizing Calculation:**
```
Position Size (shares) = Capital Allocation / Entry Price
Example: $10,000 / $19.75 = 506 shares (SNDX)
```

**Stop-Loss Calculation:**
```
Max Loss = (Entry Price - Stop Price) × Number of Shares
Example SNDX: ($19.75 - $16.50) × 506 shares = $1,645 max loss
```

**Risk/Reward Ratio:**
```
R:R = Potential Gain / Potential Loss
Example SNDX: $4,177 gain / $1,645 loss = 2.5:1 R:R
```

**Beta Calculation (Portfolio):**
```
Weighted Beta = Σ (Position Weight × Stock Beta)
