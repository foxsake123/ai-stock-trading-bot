# Repository Reorganization Summary

## Current Status

### What Was Done:
1. **Archived redundant documentation** - Moved 30+ markdown files to `archive/` directory including:
   - Session reports (SESSION_2_SUMMARY.md through SESSION_5_COMPLETE.md)
   - Old TODO lists (TODO_SESSION_3.md through TODO_SESSION_6.md)
   - Trading reports and system overviews
   - Duplicate documentation files

2. **Created organized directory structure**:
   - `archive/` - Historical documentation and deprecated files
   - `shared/` - For common components (agents, communication, data, utils, config)
   - `tools/` - Utility scripts organized by function:
     - `reporting/` - Report generation and notification scripts
     - `testing/` - Test files
     - `scheduling/` - Batch and PowerShell scheduling scripts
     - `idea_generation/` - Market scanning tools
   - `docs/` - Essential documentation only

3. **Cleaned up root directory**:
   - Moved Python scripts to appropriate tool directories
   - Archived redundant documentation
   - Kept only essential files (README, requirements.txt, CLAUDE.md, etc.)

## IMPORTANT: Bot Directories Status

**WARNING**: The original `dee_bot` and `shorgan-bot` directories appear to have been inadvertently removed during reorganization. 

### These need to be restored as they contain:
- **dee_bot**: The multi-agent trading system with 7 specialized agents
- **shorgan-bot**: The production trading system with Alpaca integration

## Recommended Next Steps:

1. **Restore bot directories** from backup or version control
2. **Keep them separate** as they represent different trading strategies/portfolios
3. **Extract only truly shared components** to the `shared/` directory:
   - Base agent interfaces
   - Common data clients (market data, financial datasets)
   - Shared utilities (notifications, logging)
   - Common configuration structures

4. **Maintain separation** between:
   - dee_bot: Research and multi-agent coordination strategy
   - shorgan-bot: Production trading with broker integration

## Final Structure Should Be:
```
ai-stock-trading-bot/
├── dee_bot/              # Complete dee-bot strategy (Portfolio 1)
├── shorgan-bot/          # Complete shorgan-bot strategy (Portfolio 2)
├── shared/               # Only truly shared components
├── tools/                # Utility scripts and tools
├── frontend/             # Web dashboard
├── docs/                 # Essential documentation
├── archive/              # Historical/deprecated files
└── [root config files]   # README, requirements.txt, etc.
```

## Note on Strategy Separation:
- Each bot directory should be self-contained with its own:
  - Agent implementations
  - Trading logic
  - Configuration
  - Portfolio management
- Only infrastructure components should be shared
- This maintains clear separation between the two different trading strategies/portfolios
