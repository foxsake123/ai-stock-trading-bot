## KEY LESSONS LEARNED

### 1. Always Verify Data Sources
**Issue**: Used wrong ChatGPT data file, creating invalid analysis
**Lesson**: Always confirm data source paths and verify with user before major decisions
**Impact**: Entire analysis had to be re-done

### 2. SHORT Positions Score Differently
**Issue**: Initially flagged PLUG short as "too low" at 59%
**Lesson**: SHORT positions naturally score lower on Bull metrics - this is correct
**Solution**: Adjusted interpretation, included despite <70% threshold

### 3. Directional Conflicts Must Be Flagged
**Issue**: BYND had opposing signals (ChatGPT SHORT vs Claude LONG)
**Lesson**: Cannot execute trades when research sources disagree on direction
**Solution**: Created explicit conflict detection and skip logic

### 4. Price Verification Critical
**Issue**: Alpaca API gave bad after-hours quotes (NEE $38 instead of $80)
**Lesson**: Always verify prices pre-market before execution
**Solution**: Created verify_all_research_prices.py utility

### 5. User Communication Is Key
**Issue**: User had to catch my data error and show PDF
**Lesson**: Present data sources explicitly for user verification
**Improvement**: Always show "Using ChatGPT data from: {path}" in analysis

### 6. Repository Reviews Reveal Hidden Technical Debt
**Issue**: Repository had 37MB of duplicate code, 3.4% test coverage, 6 legacy directories
**Lesson**: Regular comprehensive reviews are essential for maintaining code quality
**Solution**: Created 3-week structured cleanup plan with prioritized action items
**Impact**: Identified critical gaps that could have caused production issues
