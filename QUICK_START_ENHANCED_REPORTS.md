**Solution:** Normal if no trades generated/executed
- Research may not have generated: `python scripts/automation/daily_claude_research.py --force`
- Trades may not have been approved: `python scripts/automation/generate_todays_trades_v2.py`

### Issue: "Portfolio data not available"
**Solution:** Check Alpaca API connection
- Verify ALPACA_API_KEY and ALPACA_SECRET_KEY in `.env`
