    "OverallMarketSentiment": 6,
    "Explanation": "The market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, reflecting a balance between ongoing concerns about inflation and interest rate hikes, and optimism driven by resilient economic data and corporate earnings. Recent Federal Reserve actions suggest a potential slowdown in rate increases, providing some relief to investors.

    "RecommendedPortfolioPositioning": {
