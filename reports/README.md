   - Copies to `reports/premarket/latest/`

2. **Review Research** (manual - 10-15 minutes)
   - Read `consensus.md` for synthesis
   - Deep dive into `claude_research.md` or `chatgpt_research.md` as needed
   - Note any major divergences or warnings

3. **Prepare for Tomorrow** (manual - 5 minutes)
   - Review `trades.md` for execution plan
   - Set price alerts for entries/stops
   - Note key catalysts (CPI, earnings, FDA decisions)

### Morning (pre-market)

1. **Check for Updates** (5 minutes before open)
   ```bash
   python health_check.py
   python get_portfolio_status.py
   ```

## üìä Report Comparison Guide

### When to Favor Claude's Recommendations

‚úÖ **Use Claude when:**
- You want longer-term holds (30-90+ days)
- You value detailed scenario analysis
- You prefer M&A arbitrage or partnership plays
- You want ultra-defensive positioning (beta 0.41)
- You appreciate expected value calculations

**Claude's Strengths:**
- Comprehensive fundamental analysis (18+ metrics)
- Detailed alternative data integration
- Sophisticated risk/reward modeling
- Conservative position sizing (Kelly Criterion)

**Example**: PTGX M&A arbitrage (60-90 day timeline, detailed diligence analysis)

### When to Favor ChatGPT's Recommendations

‚úÖ **Use ChatGPT when:**
- You want near-term catalysts (1-14 days)
- You prefer defined-risk setups
- You like FDA PDUFA clusters
- You want market-matching returns (beta ~1.0)
- You value concise, tactical execution

**ChatGPT's Strengths:**
- Imminent catalyst focus (< 2 weeks)
- Built-in risk controls (auto-trim rules)
- Clean execution table format
- Balanced defensive approach

**Example**: GKOS PDUFA Oct 20 (6 days away, clear risk-defined setup)

### When to Use Consensus

‚≠ê **Always review `consensus.md` first:**
- Identifies high-conviction overlaps (both AIs agree)
- Provides balanced portfolio construction
- Synthesizes complementary perspectives
- Includes hybrid approaches (best of both)

**Recommended Strategy**: Execute consensus recommendations which combine:
- Claude's high-conviction longs (PTGX)
- ChatGPT's imminent catalysts (GKOS, SNDX)
- Overlapping defensives (JNJ, PG)
- Diversified approach across both AI perspectives

## üóÇÔ∏è Archive Policy

### Automated Archiving (planned)

Reports older than 30 days are automatically moved to `reports/archive/YYYY-MM/`:

```bash
# Run monthly (automated)
python scripts/utilities/archive_old_reports.py --days=30
```

### Manual Archive Access

To access historical reports:

```bash
# List archived months
ls reports/archive/

# View specific month
ls reports/archive/2025-10/

# Extract from archive (if needed)
cp reports/archive/2025-10/YYYY-MM-DD/ reports/premarket/

## ‚ùì FAQ

**Q: Which report should I read first?**
A: Always start with `consensus.md` - it synthesizes both AI perspectives and provides actionable recommendations.

**Q: What if Claude and ChatGPT completely disagree?**
A: This is actually valuable! It shows diverse perspectives. The consensus report helps you understand why they diverge and suggests balanced approaches.

**Q: Can I execute only one AI's recommendations?**
A: Yes, but you lose diversification benefits. Consensus recommendations typically outperform either AI alone.

**Q: How often are reports generated?**
A: Daily at 6:00 PM ET (automated). Fresh reports available for next trading day by evening.

**Q: What if I miss the 6 PM generation?**
A: Reports are saved in `latest/` and persist until overwritten. You can review them anytime before market open.

**Q: Are stop losses mandatory?**
A: For SHORGAN positions, YES (15-20% stops). For DEE-BOT, stops are optional but 10% portfolio drawdown is a reassessment trigger.
