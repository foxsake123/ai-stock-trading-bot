**Summary**: Executing disciplined rebalancing by taking FDX profits (+30.6%) and cutting NFLX losses (-8.9%). Deploying capital into three high-conviction catalyst plays: RIVN (production numbers), PLUG (policy update), and MRNA (earnings rebound). Adding modest options exposure for LCID earnings upside and PLUG downside protection. Portfolio remains well-balanced with strong cash buffer and strict risk controls.
