All positions now have defined stops:
- Mental stops converted to GTC orders
- Shorts have tighter 8-10% stops
- Options limited to defined risk strategies
- No earnings holds without conviction

### Weekend Checklist:
1. ✓ Review all positions for catalyst updates
2. ✓ Check margin levels and cash position
3. ✓ Identify exit candidates (STLA, CVX)
4. ✓ Screen for new catalyst opportunities
5. ✓ Update stop losses for winners
6. ✓ Prepare for major earnings week
7. ✓ Review options expiration calendar

**KEY FOCUS**: This week is MASSIVE for earnings. AMD/GOOGL Tuesday, AMZN/AAPL Thursday will move markets. Position accordingly with hedges in place. Exit disasters (STLA), trim winners (ENPH), and add high-conviction catalyst plays (NVDA, COIN). Margin situation improves to -$19K, well above the -$30K danger zone.

**CONVICTION**: The portfolio is positioned for a volatile earnings week with appropriate hedges. Focus on quality catalyst plays only - NO speculation in this market environment.
