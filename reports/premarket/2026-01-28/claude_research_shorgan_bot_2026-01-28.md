## 12. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Portfolio Risk Parameters:**
- **Max Position**: $10,000 (10% of capital) ✓
- **Max Sector**: 25% concentration (Tech at 23% post-rebalance) ✓
- **Stop Loss Rules**: 10% stocks, 12% shorts ✓
- **Options Limit**: <5% currently (room for strategies) ✓
- **Cash Target**: -$29,904 (Just within -$30K limit) ✓
- **MARGIN FLOOR**: Met after exits ✓
- **Daily Loss Limit**: $5,000 max drawdown
- **MAX POSITIONS**: Reduced from 30 to 20 ✓
- **MIN CONVICTION**: Only 7+ scores for new entries ✓

**Risk Monitoring:**
1. **Margin Call Risk**: RESOLVED - Cash above -$30K after exits
2. **Concentration Risk**: RESOLVED - No position >10% after trims
3. **Catalyst Risk**: Monitor MSFT/META earnings impact on tech
4. **Volatility Risk**: VIX spike would hurt leveraged longs
5. **Correlation Risk**: Tech-heavy but diversifying

**Daily Checklist:**
- [ ] Pre-market: Review overnight moves, news
- [ ] 9:30 AM: Execute exit orders first
- [ ] 10:00 AM: Place new position orders
- [ ] 2:00 PM: Adjust limits if needed
- [ ] 3:30 PM: Final order modifications
- [ ] Close: Document fills, update tracking

**Emergency Protocol:**
- If cash drops below -$35K intraday: EXIT 3 lowest conviction positions immediately
- If any position drops >15%: Evaluate thesis, likely exit
- If SPY drops >2%: Reduce gross exposure by 20%
- If VIX spikes >20: Close all shorts, reduce leverage

**Success Metrics:**
- Win rate target: >55%
- Average winner/loser ratio: >1.5:1
- Sharpe ratio target: >1.5
- Max drawdown limit: 15%
- Daily tracking vs SPY benchmark

**FINAL NOTES:**

This rebalancing is CRITICAL to portfolio health. We're executing a major cleanup to:
1. Get margin under control (from -$111K to -$30K)
2. Reduce positions from 30 to 20
3. Take profits on huge winners
4. Cut losing positions with no catalysts
5. Position for upcoming tech earnings catalysts

The market remains constructive but selective. Focus on quality setups with defined catalysts in the next 14 days. MSFT and META earnings this week will set the tone for tech. PCE inflation Friday could move rate-sensitive names.

Remember: **Better to miss an opportunity than to lose capital on low-conviction trades.**

Execute the exit orders FIRST to secure the cash, then place new positions. This is not a drill - margin violations can force unplanned liquidations.
