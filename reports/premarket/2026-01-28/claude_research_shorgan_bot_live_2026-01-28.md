## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

**SPY Commentary**: Currently at $694.52, showing continued strength near all-time highs. The market remains in a bullish trend with solid support at $680 and resistance around $700. Small-cap exposure should be carefully managed in this large-cap dominated rally.

**QQQ Commentary**: Trading at $629.69, tech sector showing resilience despite elevated valuations. Mega-cap tech continues to lead, but growth stocks outside the Magnificent 7 remain under pressure. Watch for rotation opportunities.

**IWM Commentary**: Small-caps at $264.26, underperforming large-caps significantly. This weakness in small-caps is concerning for our portfolio composition. Need to be selective with small/mid-cap exposure.

**Upcoming Macro Events**:
- Wednesday Jan 28: MBA Mortgage Applications
- Thursday Jan 29: GDP Q4 First Estimate (Consensus: +2.7%)
- Friday Jan 30: PCE Inflation Data (Key Fed indicator)
- Friday Jan 30: Consumer Sentiment Final

**Catalyst-Rich Sectors**: 
- Financials: Earnings season continues
- Healthcare: FDA decisions pending
- Technology: AI narrative still driving valuations

**Volatility Regime**: VIX around 13-15 indicates low volatility. Options premiums are compressed, making long options less attractive but good for selling premium.

**IV Rank Context**: Overall market IV in the 20th percentile - very low. This suggests avoiding buying options unless for specific binary events.

## 11. RISK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

**Daily Loss Limit**: $300 (10% of portfolio)
- Current unrealized loss: -$120.67
- Room for additional loss: $179.33
- If additional $179 loss → NO new trades

**Position Stop-Loss Rules:**
- Stocks: 15% hard stop from entry
- Options: 50% of premium
- Shorts: 18% stop (tighter due to unlimited risk)

**Current Risk Assessment:**
- Portfolio down 4.5% - MUST be selective
- Exiting 2 losers frees capital and reduces risk
- New positions have near-term catalysts
- Options position sized appropriately (5.9% of portfolio)

**Position Sizing Guardrails:**
- New positions: $202-224 each (7-8% of portfolio)
- Well within $75-300 guidelines
- After trades: 11 positions (under 12 max)

**Cash Buffer Target**: $400-600
- Current: $87.07 (too low)
- After rebalancing: ~$98 (still low but improving)
- Need profitable exits to rebuild buffer

**Review Triggers:**
- Portfolio at -4.5% (TRIGGERED) → Executed exits of underperformers
- BCRX at -5.4% (TRIGGERED) → Exit position
- If drops to -7% → Reduce all position sizes by 25%

**Tomorrow's Focus:**
1. Execute exits cleanly at market open
2. Place limit orders for new positions
3. Monitor LCID for delivery news timing
