## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

- **SPY Commentary**: Trading at $689.79, showing strong momentum. Market remains risk-on with technology leading. Support at $685, resistance at $695. Extended run requires caution.

- **QQQ Commentary**: At $620.54, tech sector continues leadership. AI and semiconductor themes dominating. Watch for rotation as valuations stretch. Support $615, resistance $625.

- **IWM Commentary**: Small-caps at $258.19 showing relative strength. Our universe benefiting from risk-on sentiment. Breakout above $260 would signal further small-cap outperformance.

- **Upcoming Macro Events**: 
  - January 10 (Friday): December PPI data
  - January 15: December CPI release (critical for Fed)
  - January 16: Retail sales data
  - January 17: U of Michigan consumer sentiment

- **Catalyst-Rich Sectors**: Biotech (FDA decisions), Fintech (earnings), EV (production updates), Software (earnings pre-announcements)

- **Volatility Regime**: VIX unavailable but market spreads indicate low volatility. Options premiums compressed - favor stock trades over options.

- **IV Rank Context**: Based on tight spreads (0.01-0.04% on liquid names), implied volatility is low. Binary event plays offer best risk/reward.
