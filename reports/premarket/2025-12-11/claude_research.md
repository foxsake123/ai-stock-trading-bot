## 2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY & MARKET CONTEXT

**Market Backdrop:**
- **S&P 500 Level**: ~6,000 | Testing resistance at psychological level

- **Portfolio Beta**: ~1.05 (slightly aggressive vs 1.0 target)
- **Issue Count**: 18 positions (EXCESSIVE - target is 10-12)
- **Cash Level**: 6.0% (above 3% target - good liquidity)
- **Overweight Positions**: 4 positions >8% need trimming
- **Style Drift**: Too many positions diluting quality focus

**Top 3 Conviction Ideas This Week:**
1. **TRIM Overweights**: T, GILD, JPM, WMT to 7% allocations
2. **EXIT Weak Positions**: NEE (broken thesis), PG (deteriorating fundamentals)
3. **CONSOLIDATE**: Reduce from 18 to 12 quality holdings

**CRITICAL ACTIONS FOR THURSDAY, DECEMBER 11:**

1. **RESTORE POSITIVE CASH** - Execute exits/trims at market open
2. **WATCH CPI DATA** - Released 8:30 AM ET, may impact markets
3. **PLACE NEW ORDERS** - Use limit orders for entries after volatility settles
4. **MONITOR POSITIONS** - CHWY approaching earnings, PATH analyst day next week

This rebalancing transforms our portfolio from an overweight, cash-negative state to a properly balanced, catalyst-focused portfolio with healthy cash reserves. We're exiting dead money positions (EDIT, PLUG), trimming overweight winners, and rotating into higher conviction plays with near-term catalysts.
