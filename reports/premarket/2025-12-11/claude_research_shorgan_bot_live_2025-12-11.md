**CRITICAL ACTIONS FOR THURSDAY, DECEMBER 11:**

1. **RESTORE POSITIVE CASH** - Execute exits/trims at market open
2. **WATCH CPI DATA** - Released 8:30 AM ET, may impact markets
3. **PLACE NEW ORDERS** - Use limit orders for entries after volatility settles
4. **MONITOR POSITIONS** - CHWY approaching earnings, PATH analyst day next week

This rebalancing transforms our portfolio from an overweight, cash-negative state to a properly balanced, catalyst-focused portfolio with healthy cash reserves. We're exiting dead money positions (EDIT, PLUG), trimming overweight winners, and rotating into higher conviction plays with near-term catalysts.
