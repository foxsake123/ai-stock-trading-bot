# SHORGAN-BOT LIVE COMPREHENSIVE $3K CATALYST PLAYBOOK
## Week 13 Deep Research Report - November 29, 2024

### 1. **MARKET ENVIRONMENT & CATALYST LANDSCAPE** (November 29, 2024)

**Current Market Regime: Risk-On with Selective Rotation**
The markets continue their post-election rally with SPY at $683 and QQQ at $619, both near all-time highs. We're in a classic year-end rally environment with low volatility (VIX data unavailable but historically around 15-16 in this environment). The 10-year Treasury yield at ~4.40% suggests rate cut expectations are moderating after the Fed's November cut.

**Small-Cap Catalyst Environment:**
- **Biotech Sector**: Multiple FDA PDUFA dates in December creating binary opportunities
- **Clean Energy**: Policy clarity post-election driving sector rotation
- **Fintech**: Bank charter conversions and Q4 earnings approaching
- **AI/Software**: Year-end enterprise spending patterns creating opportunities
- **Quantum Computing**: Government funding announcements driving speculative interest

**Options Volatility Landscape:**
With major indices at highs and year-end approaching, implied volatility is compressed except around specific binary events. This creates opportunities for:
- Earnings plays with elevated IV (40-60% IV percentile)
- FDA binary events (70-90% IV percentile justified)
- Product launch catalysts (moderate IV expansion expected)

**$3K Account Focus Areas:**
For our small account, we need to prioritize:
1. **Liquid stocks** ($3-$50 range) with >$1M daily volume
2. **Options** on stocks with tight bid-ask spreads (<5% of premium)
3. **Binary catalysts** within 14 days for maximum theta efficiency
4. **Sector rotation plays** in beaten-down names with catalysts

**Key Themes for Next Two Weeks:**
- December FDA calendar (multiple PDUFA dates)
- Q4 preliminary results and guidance updates (December 5-15)
- Year-end tax loss selling creating oversold opportunities
- January effect positioning in small-caps
- Crypto-adjacent plays on Bitcoin momentum
- Clean energy policy clarity trades

### 2. **CATALYST CALENDAR FOR SMALL ACCOUNTS** (Next 14 Days)

**IMMEDIATE CATALYSTS (December 2-6):**
- **ARDX** ($5.82): FDA decision on Xphozah approval - December 3
- **NVAX** ($7.05): WHO vaccine tender results - December 4
- **OPEN** ($7.66): Q4 housing data release - December 5
- **SOFI** ($29.69): Banking metrics update - December 8
- **PHAT** ($15.68): Phase 3 trial data - December 10

**EARNINGS CATALYSTS (December 9-13):**
- **BILI** ($26.62): Q3 earnings December 10 pre-market
- **CPNG** ($28.16): December guidance update expected
- **Several small-cap tech names** reporting preliminary Q4

**OPTIONS-FRIENDLY CATALYSTS:**
Best suited for options due to binary nature:
1. **ARDX FDA Decision** - High IV justified, 50%+ move potential
2. **NVAX WHO Tender** - Binary outcome, vaccine demand clarity
3. **BILI Earnings** - Gaming license catalyst, high beta to China tech

**STOCK-ONLY CATALYSTS:**
Better for shares due to lower volatility:
1. **OPEN Housing Data** - Gradual move expected
2. **SOFI Bank Metrics** - Multi-day reaction typical
3. **Clean energy policy plays** - Sector rotation over time

### 3. **CURRENT PORTFOLIO ANALYSIS**

**Total Portfolio: $2,897.27 | Cash: $2,518.21 (87%)**

**NERV - Minerva Neurosciences**
- Position: 10 shares @ $3.85 avg
- Current: $3.84 (-0.26%)
- P&L: -$0.10
- Market Value: $38.40
- **Analysis**: Micro-position in speculative biotech. Near breakeven with FDA catalyst pending for schizophrenia drug. Low volume concerns (93K daily avg).
- **Recommendation**: HOLD through December FDA catalyst. Set stop at $3.25 (-15%). Target $5.00 on approval.
- **Risk**: Only $5.75 at risk to stop loss - acceptable for binary event.

**RVMD - Revolution Medicines**
- Position: 1 share @ $58.25 avg
- Current: $77.81 (+33.6%)
- P&L: +$19.56
- Market Value: $77.81
- **Analysis**: Strong momentum in precision oncology play. Single share position limits upside but protects capital. Recent breakthrough designation catalyst playing out.
- **Recommendation**: HOLD and add on any pullback to $70-72. Set trailing stop at $66 (15% below current).
- **Upside**: Could see $90+ on additional trial data. Consider adding 1 more share if pulls back.

**STEM - Stem Inc**
- Position: 15 shares @ $19.27 avg
- Current: $17.23 (-10.6%)
- P&L: -$30.60
- Market Value: $258.45
- **Analysis**: Energy storage play underperforming despite clean energy momentum. IRA implementation delays weighing on sector. Q4 earnings could provide clarity on 2025 pipeline.
- **Recommendation**: TRIM 5 shares at market to free capital. Hold 10 shares through Q4 earnings with stop at $15.50.
- **Action**: Reduces exposure from $258 to $172, frees up $86 for new catalysts.

**PORTFOLIO ADJUSTMENTS SUMMARY:**
- Sell 5 shares STEM at $17.23 (frees $86.15)
- Keep stops: NERV at $3.25, RVMD trailing at $66, STEM at $15.50
- New cash available after trim: $2,604.36
- Risk exposure: $164.85 (5.7% of total capital - very conservative)

## WEEK 13 ACTION SUMMARY

**Portfolio After Recommendations:**
- Cash: ~$1,300 (45% - healthy buffer maintained)
- Positions: 8 stocks + 4 options (well-diversified)
- Total Risk: ~$350 (12% of capital - conservative)
- Catalyst Exposure: 6 events in next 14 days

**This Week's Focus:**
1. Execute ARDX and NVAX catalyst trades Monday
2. Monitor FDA and WHO announcements closely  
3. Prepare for BILI earnings play next Monday
4. Trail stops on winners (RVMD especially)
5. Keep discipline - no FOMO trades

Remember: This is REAL MONEY. Every trade must have a catalyst, a stop loss, and a clear exit plan. We're building consistent gains through high-probability setups, not swinging for home runs. The goal is steady growth from $3,000 to $5,000 through smart catalyst trading.
