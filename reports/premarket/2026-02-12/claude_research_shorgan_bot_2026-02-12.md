## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT & CATALYST LANDSCAPE (February 11, 2026)

**Market Regime**: NEUTRAL/CHOPPY
- SPY: $691.81 (near all-time highs, but momentum waning)
- QQQ: $613.16 (tech showing weakness)
- IWM: $265.29 (small caps consolidating)

**Index Analysis**:
- **SPY**: Trading at $691.81, testing resistance at $695. Support at $685.

- **IWM**: Small caps at $265.29, range-bound $260-270.

**Sector Momentum**:
- **HOT**: Energy (XOM $155.65, CVX $185.91) - oil prices rallying
- **STRONG**: Healthcare (MRK, PFE) - defensive rotation
- **WEAK**: Tech (AMD, NVDA flat) - post-earnings fatigue
- **FADING**: Consumer discretionary (AMZN weakness)

**VIX Analysis**: Unable to retrieve, but market spreads suggest low volatility environment continues (13-15 range based on tight SPY/QQQ spreads).

**Upcoming Major Events (Week of Feb 9-13, 2026)**:
- **Thursday, Feb 12**: CPI Data (8:30 AM ET) - High impact
- **Friday, Feb 13**: Retail Sales, Consumer Sentiment
- **Next Week**: FOMC Minutes (Feb 19)

**Short Squeeze Watchlist**:
- RIOT (crypto momentum building)
- SMCI (high short interest, AI exposure)

## 12. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Position Metrics**:
- **Max Position**: $10,000 (10% of capital) - ENFORCED
- **Max Sector**: 25% concentration - OK (Tech at 20%)
- **Stop Loss Rules**: 10% stocks, 12% shorts - TIGHTENED
- **Options Limit**: 20% of portfolio - Currently 0%
- **Cash Target**: $15,000-$25,000 - Will achieve $25,196 after exits
- **MARGIN FLOOR**: Cash must stay above -$30,000 - SAFE
- **Daily Loss Limit**: $5,000 - Monitoring
- **MAX POSITIONS**: 15-20 total - Currently 17, will be 15 after rebalance
- **MIN CONVICTION**: 7/10 required - All new entries meet threshold

**Risk Flags**:
1. COIN earnings tomorrow - binary risk, hedged with puts
2. CPI data Thursday morning - market-wide impact
3. Energy exposure high (OXY) - trimming appropriately

**Portfolio Quality Metrics**:
- Average Conviction Score: 6.2/10 (improving to 7.1 after exits)
- Catalyst Density: 8 positions with catalysts in next 14 days
- Win Rate: 53% (9 winners, 8 losers)

**Stop Loss Monitoring**:

- DKNG: Support at $25, stop at $24
- All new positions have defined stops

**Next Review Triggers**:
1. COIN earnings results (Thursday after close)
2. CPI print (Thursday 8:30 AM)
3. Any position hitting -10% loss
4. Cash dropping below $10,000

---

**TRADING PHILOSOPHY**: 
We're tightening discipline after the CVX short debacle. No more low-conviction trades. Every position needs a clear catalyst within 14 days or gets cut. The market's giving us gift exits on AMZN and MARA - we're taking them. Fresh powder goes into high-conviction catalyst plays only. Quality over quantity wins this game.

Remember: This is PAPER TRADING. Real money would require even tighter risk controls.
