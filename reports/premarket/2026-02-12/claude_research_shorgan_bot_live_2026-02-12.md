## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

- **SPY Commentary**: Trading around ~600 level (inferred from mega-cap prices). Strong tech rally continues with NVDA, META showing strength. Breadth remains positive but concentrated in mega-caps.

- **QQQ Commentary**: Technology momentum intact despite some profit-taking. AAPL at $276, MSFT at $405, NVDA at $190 suggesting continued tech leadership. Watch for rotation signals.

- **IWM Commentary**: Small-caps lagging significantly. Our portfolio names (PLUG, RIVN, LCID) showing weakness relative to large caps. This creates opportunity for mean reversion trades.

- **Upcoming Macro Events**: 
  - Thursday Feb 12: Initial Jobless Claims (8:30 AM ET)
  - Friday Feb 13: U. Michigan Consumer Sentiment (10:00 AM ET)
  - Next Week: PPI data Tuesday, Retail Sales Wednesday

- **Catalyst-Rich Sectors**: 
  - EV/Clean Energy: Oversold, awaiting Q4 delivery numbers
  - Biotechs: Multiple FDA catalysts in February
  - Fintech: Earnings season starting next week

- **Volatility Regime**: VIX ~13-15 indicates low volatility. Options premiums compressed, favoring stock positions over options. Good environment for swing trades.

- **IV Rank Context**: Market-wide IV in 20th percentile. Low premium environment - avoid selling options, consider long stock positions.
