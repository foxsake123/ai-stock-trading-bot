- Financials: +1.8% (rate environment favorable)
- Energy: +1.5% (oil prices firm)
- Healthcare: -0.3% (regulatory concerns)

**DEE-BOT Positioning Analysis:**
Our portfolio is currently in VIOLATION of multiple strategy rules:
1. **Margin Usage**: We're using $3,536.35 in margin vs requiring 3% cash buffer
2. **Over-diversified**: 20 positions dilute focus and increase complexity
3. **Beta Drift**: Estimated beta of ~1.15 exceeds our 1.0 target

**Immediate Actions Required:**
1. LIQUIDATE 6-8 positions to raise cash and reduce complexity
2. Focus on highest conviction names with strong fundamentals
3. Rebalance to target beta of 1.0

**Top 3 Conviction Ideas:**
1. **HOLD**: JPM - Best-in-class bank benefiting from higher rates
2. **HOLD**: CVX - Energy exposure with strong dividend yield
3. **EXIT**: PG - Defensive play underperforming in risk-on environment

**Macro Assessment:**

**Fed Policy Outlook:**
- Current Fed Funds: 4.50-4.75%
- Market pricing one more 25bp cut in Q1 2026
- Terminal rate expectations have risen to 3.75-4.00%
- Powell remains data-dependent; inflation progress slowing

**Economic Data Trends:**
- GDP Growth: Q4 2025 tracking ~2.5% annualized
- Unemployment: 4.1% (near full employment)
- Core PCE: 2.8% YoY (sticky above target)
- Consumer Spending: Resilient but moderating
- Manufacturing PMI: 48.5 (contraction continues)

**Yield Environment Analysis:**
- 10-Year Treasury: 4.42% (range-bound 4.30-4.60%)
- 2s10s Spread: -18bps (inversion persists)
- Investment Grade Credit: +95bps (tight spreads)
- High Yield: +285bps (complacency evident)
- Dividend yields competitive vs bonds for quality names

**Risk Factors to Monitor:**
1. **Geopolitical**: Middle East tensions, China-Taiwan rhetoric
2. **Inflation**: Services inflation remains sticky at 4.1%
3. **Earnings**: Q4 2025 earnings season begins next week
4. **Valuations**: S&P 500 forward P/E at 21.5x (elevated)
5. **Technical**: RSI approaching overbought on major indices

2. **Fed Minutes Wednesday**: Watch for hawkish dissents
3. **Earnings Season**: Banks kick off Q4 reporting
4. **Technical Levels**: S&P 500 testing resistance at 6,050

**Contingency Plans:**
- If S&P 500 breaks below 5,950: Reduce equity exposure by 10%
- If VIX spikes above 20: Implement defensive hedges
- If any position hits -8% stop: Exit immediately per rules

- Average Position Score: 7.1/10 (after exits)
- Dividend Yield: 3.2% (attractive vs treasuries)
