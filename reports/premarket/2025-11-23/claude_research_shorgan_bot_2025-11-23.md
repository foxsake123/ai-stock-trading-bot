## **TOP CATALYST OPPORTUNITIES**

### 1. **ARWR - Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals**
**HIGHEST CONVICTION LONG**

**Setup Overview:**
Arrowhead has emerged as the leader in RNA interference therapeutics with their December 2 PDUFA date for ARO-AAT, treating alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency. The FDA has been increasingly supportive of RNA therapies post-COVID, and ARWR's Phase 3 SEQUOIA study showed unprecedented 94% reduction in liver AAT protein with excellent safety profile. The market is underestimating approval probability due to biotech fatigue.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Market cap: $2.8B (room to run to $5B+ on approval)
- Cash position: $626M (2+ years runway)
- Pipeline depth: 12 programs in clinic
- Partnership potential with big pharma post-approval
- Short interest: 12% providing squeeze fuel

**Technical Setup:**
- Current: $40.45
- 52-week range: $22.14 - $43.69
- Key resistance: $43.70 (52-week high)
- Support: $38.50 (20-day MA)
- Volume surge last 3 days on accumulation
- RSI: 58 (room to run)

**Catalyst Details:**
- PDUFA Date: December 2, 2025 (decision by midnight)
- FDA Advisory Committee: Voted 12-2 in favor
- Competing therapies inferior efficacy
- Orphan drug designation provides pricing power

**Trade Structure:**
- Entry: $40.00 - $41.00 (scale in)
- Position size: 300 shares (5% of portfolio)
- Target 1: $52.00 (+28%) - FDA approval pop
- Target 2: $58.00 (+43%) - Partnership announcement
- Stop loss: $37.50 (-7%) - below support
- Time horizon: Hold through December 2

**Risk/Reward Scenarios:**
- Bull case (75% probability): FDA approval, immediate pop to $52+, partnership within 30 days drives to $60+
- Base case (20% probability): Approval with manufacturing restrictions, consolidates $45-48
- Bear case (5% probability): Complete response letter, drops to $28-30 support

### 2. **PLUG - Plug Power SHORT**
**HIGH CONVICTION SHORT**

**Setup Overview:**
PLUG has rallied 40% in two weeks on vague "partnership" rumors that smell like classic pump before dilution. The company burns $200M+ per quarter, has missed every guidance for 5 years, and faces massive competition in green hydrogen. Monday's rumored announcement is likely another non-binding MOU that means nothing. Perfect short setup.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Persistent cash burn: -$823M TTM
- Dilution machine: Share count up 400% in 3 years  
- Competition intensifying from established players
- Government subsidies drying up
- History of overpromising and underdelivering

**Technical Setup:**
- Current: $2.03
- Recent spike from $1.45 to $2.10 on rumors
- Resistance: $2.15 (previous fail point)
- No real support until $1.50
- Volume suspicious (potential manipulation)
- RSI: 71 (overbought)

**Catalyst Details:**
- Monday November 25: "Major partnership" announcement expected
- History shows these are always disappointments
- Likely non-binding letter of intent
- Market expecting too much

**Trade Structure:**
- Entry: $2.00 - $2.10 SHORT
- Position size: 2000 shares short
- Target 1: $1.70 (-16%)
- Target 2: $1.45 (-29%)
- Stop loss: $2.25 (+10%) - tight stop
- Time horizon: 1-5 days

**Risk/Reward Scenarios:**
- Bear case (70% probability): Weak announcement, drops to $1.70 immediately
- Base case (20% probability): Sideways $1.90-2.10 until next catalyst
- Bull case (10% probability): Real partnership surprise, squeeze to $2.40

### 3. **SMCI - Super Micro Computer**
**BINARY DELISTING PLAY**

**Setup Overview:**
SMCI faces potential Nasdaq delisting on Monday after failing to file financials. This is a pure binary event - either they get an extension (stock recovers to $40+) or get delisted (drops to $20). Options market pricing 50/50 odds, but I believe extension is 65% likely as Nasdaq rarely delists $10B+ companies immediately.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Accounting issues but business intact
- Major customers (NVDA, AMD) still ordering
- $8B revenue run rate if legitimate
- New auditor search ongoing
- 32% short interest creates squeeze potential

**Technical Setup:**
- Current: $32.21
- 52-week range: $17.25 - $122.90
- Make or break level: $30
- Upside target: $42 (previous support)
- Downside risk: $20 (delisting scenario)

**Catalyst Details:**
- Monday November 25: Nasdaq decision due by 4 PM ET
- Extension would give 60-180 days to file
- Delisting would force OTC trading
- Binary outcome with massive move

**Trade Structure:**
- **CALL SPREAD:** Buy Dec 6 $32/$40 call spread
- Cost: $2.80 per spread
- Max gain: $5.20 (+186%)
- Max loss: $2.80 (-100%)
- Buy 5 contracts risking $1,400
- Breakeven: $34.80

**Risk/Reward Scenarios:**
- Bull case (65% probability): Extension granted, immediate pop to $38-42
- Bear case (35% probability): Delisting announced, drops to $20-22

### 4. **MRNA - Moderna LONG**
**CANCER VACCINE CATALYST**

**Setup Overview:**
Everyone has forgotten about Moderna at $23, but they're about to announce Phase 2 data for their personalized cancer vaccine on Tuesday. Early data showed 44% reduction in recurrence - if confirmed, this is a $100B market opportunity. Stock priced for failure after COVID vaccine decline.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Market cap: $9B (was $190B at peak)
- Cash: $13B (more than market cap!)
- Cancer vaccine TAM: $100B+ by 2030
- Partnership with Merck validates approach
- Pipeline beyond COVID undervalued

**Technical Setup:**
- Current: $23.73
- 52-week range: $19.31 - $71.45
- Major support: $22.00
- Resistance: $28, then $35
- Oversold on all timeframes
- Short interest: 18%

**Catalyst Details:**

- Positive data triggers partnership expansion

**Trade Structure:**

- Position size: 400 shares
- Target 1: $30.00 (+26%)
- Target 2: $35.00 (+47%)
- Stop loss: $21.50 (-9%)
- Options overlay: Buy 5x Dec 20 $25 calls @ $1.20

**Risk/Reward Scenarios:**
- Bull case (60% probability): Positive efficacy, stock to $30+
- Base case (25% probability): Mixed results, consolidates $23-26
- Bear case (15% probability): Disappointing data, drops to $20

### 5. **COIN - Coinbase SHORT**
**CRYPTO REGULATION OVERHANG**

**Setup Overview:**
COIN has rallied to $240 on crypto enthusiasm, but regulatory hammer coming Wednesday. Treasury's stablecoin rules will cut into their highest margin business. Plus Bitcoin showing exhaustion at $100K. Perfect short into news.

**Technical Setup:**

- Overbought after 90% rally
- Resistance: $250
- Support breaks at $220

**Trade Structure:**

- Time: 3-7 days

### 6. **LI - Li Auto LONG**
