**Immediate Actions (November 22):**
1. EXIT LCID position (-$105 loss, free up $246)
2. ENTER PLUG stock + calls (DOE catalyst)
3. ENTER SNAP recovery play
4. ENTER MARA Bitcoin momentum

**Next Week Actions (Nov 25-26):**
1. ENTER CMPS before FDA data
2. ENTER BILI before earnings
3. Add DNA and secondary positions

**Risk/Reward Summary:**
- Total New Positions: 8-10
- Average Upside Target: +40%
- Average Downside Risk: -15%
- Risk/Reward Ratio: 2.7:1
- Win Rate Needed: 37% (achievable)

**Key Success Factors:**
1. Discipline on stops (no exceptions)
2. Catalyst timing precision
3. Options profit-taking at 50%
4. Cash buffer maintenance
5. No revenge trading

The next 14 days offer exceptional catalyst density with multiple 30-50% opportunities. Our small account is perfectly sized to capture these moves without overexposure. Focus on execution, not perfection.

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
- This is REAL MONEY - every dollar matters
- Stops are not suggestions - they're rules

- Small accounts compound fast with discipline

Execute with confidence, manage with discipline, and let the catalysts work.
