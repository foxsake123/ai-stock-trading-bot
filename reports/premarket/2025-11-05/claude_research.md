# DEE-BOT WEEKLY RESEARCH REPORT
## Week 10 Strategic Analysis & Portfolio Positioning
### Date: November 5, 2025 | Portfolio Value: $100,808.51

---

## 1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Market Environment Assessment:**
The S&P 500 continues its methodical advance, supported by resilient corporate earnings and a constructive Fed policy stance. VIX levels remain subdued near 15-17, suggesting market complacency that warrants defensive positioning. Large-cap quality names are showing relative strength as institutional investors rotate toward safety amid elevated valuations. The S&P 100 constituents, representing the market's most liquid and established companies, offer attractive risk-adjusted opportunities for capital preservation.

**Key Macro Catalysts This Week:**
- Federal Reserve officials speaking throughout the week (monitoring for policy shift signals)
- Q3 earnings season entering final stretch with key consumer and healthcare reports
- October ISM Services data and initial jobless claims providing economic pulse check
- Treasury auctions testing bond market appetite amid fiscal concerns
- China trade data potentially impacting multinational exposure

**Current Portfolio Positioning:**
DEE-BOT's portfolio maintains a defensive tilt with 86.1% invested across 10 quality positions. Notable characteristics include:
- Overweight healthcare (MRK, UNH) and consumer staples (KO, PG, WMT)
- Technology exposure via quality leader AAPL
- Financial sector representation through JPM
- Defense contractor LMT providing geopolitical hedge
- Telecom yield via VZ

**Strategic Priorities:**
1. **Beta Management**: Current portfolio beta estimated at 0.95 - within target range, no urgent rebalancing required
2. **Quality Rotation**: Identify opportunities to upgrade from underperformers (MRK, UNH showing weakness)
3. **Yield Enhancement**: Screen for dividend aristocrats trading at attractive valuations
4. **Sector Rebalancing**: Consider adding utility exposure for additional defensive characteristics
5. **Cash Deployment**: $14,027 available for selective additions to highest-conviction ideas

**Top Three Conviction Ideas:**
1. **Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)**: Premier healthcare defensive play with 3.2% yield, trading at discount to historical valuation
2. **Microsoft (MSFT)**: Quality technology exposure with fortress balance sheet and secular AI growth tailwinds  
3. **Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)**: Ultimate defensive equity with Buffett's capital allocation expertise

## 2. MACRO & MARKET CONTEXT

**Federal Reserve Policy Framework:**
The Fed remains in a delicate balancing act between supporting growth and containing inflation expectations. Recent communications suggest:
- Terminal rate likely reached at 5.25-5.50% with potential for extended pause
- Quantitative tightening continuing at $95B/month pace
- Market pricing 60% probability of first cut by Q2 2025
- Real rates remain restrictive, favoring quality balance sheets

**Economic Data Trajectory:**
Key indicators paint a mixed but generally resilient picture:
- GDP growth moderating to 2.1% annualized pace (Atlanta Fed GDPNow)
- Core PCE inflation stubborn at 3.7% y/y, well above 2% target
- Unemployment at 3.8%, labor market showing gradual cooling
- Consumer spending resilient but shifting toward value/necessities
- Manufacturing PMI below 50 for 12th consecutive month
- Services PMI holding above 50, supporting soft landing narrative

**Sector Rotation Dynamics:**
Current market leadership reflects defensive positioning:
- **Outperforming**: Technology (quality names), Healthcare (pharma), Consumer Staples
- **Underperforming**: Real Estate (rate sensitive), Materials (China concerns), Energy (demand worries)
- **Neutral**: Financials (NIM expansion vs credit concerns), Industrials (mixed signals)

**Defensive vs Cyclical Positioning:**
The market's risk-on/risk-off toggle continues, with defensive sectors showing relative strength:
- Staples P/E premium to market at 10-year high
- Utilities benefiting from AI power demand theme
- Healthcare valuations compressed, offering opportunity
- Quality factor outperforming momentum and value styles

**Dividend Yield Environment:**
With 10-year Treasury yielding 4.5%, equity income strategies face competition:
- S&P 500 dividend yield at 1.5% creates valuation headwind
- Dividend aristocrats yielding 2.5-4% more attractive
- Focus on dividend growth potential vs current yield
- Tax-advantaged nature of qualified dividends remains beneficial

**Key Risk Factors:**
- **Geopolitical**: Middle East tensions, China-Taiwan situation, Russia-Ukraine ongoing
- **Political**: 2024 election uncertainty, regulatory shifts in tech/healthcare
- **Economic**: Sticky inflation forcing Fed's hand, commercial real estate stress
- **Market Structure**: Passive flow dominance, liquidity air pockets, correlation spikes

## 4. TOP OPPORTUNITIES

**1. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) - Premier Healthcare Defensive**

**Investment Thesis:**
JNJ represents the ultimate healthcare blue-chip with unmatched diversification across pharmaceuticals (52% of sales), medical devices (28%), and consumer products (20%). The recent Kenvue spin-off has created a more focused, higher-margin entity. Trading at a significant discount to historical valuations despite strong fundamentals, JNJ offers an asymmetric risk/reward opportunity. The company's AAA credit rating (one of only two in corporate America) provides downside protection while its robust pipeline offers upside optionality.

The pharmaceutical segment is firing on all cylinders with 10 potential blockbusters in late-stage development. Key growth drivers include Darzalex (multiple myeloma), Stelara (despite LOE in 2025), and Tremfya (psoriasis). The medical device recovery post-COVID provides additional tailwinds. With $19B in free cash flow annually and a 62-year dividend growth streak, JNJ epitomizes defensive quality.

**Fundamental Metrics:**
- P/E Ratio: 15.2x forward (vs 5-year avg 17.5x)
- Dividend Yield: 3.2% (62 consecutive years of increases)
- Revenue Growth: 6.3% projected 2024

- Multiple FDA decisions throughout 2025

**2. Microsoft (MSFT) - Quality Technology Anchor**

**Investment Thesis:**
Microsoft stands as the highest-quality technology name in the S&P 100, with unparalleled competitive moats across cloud computing (Azure), productivity software (Office 365), and emerging AI leadership through OpenAI partnership. Unlike typical high-growth tech, MSFT offers defensive characteristics through recurring subscription revenues (75%+ of total) and mission-critical enterprise relationships. The company's pivot to AI-first strategy positions it to capture the next computing paradigm shift.

Azure's 29% growth demonstrates share gains versus AWS, while the Copilot AI assistant rollout across Office creates a new $10B+ revenue opportunity. With $140B+ in annual free cash flow and disciplined capital allocation, MSFT offers growth at a reasonable price (GARP) - rare in today's market. The 0.7% dividend provides income while maintaining growth investments.

**Fundamental Metrics:**
- P/E Ratio: 28.5x forward (in-line with 5-year average)
- Dividend Yield: 0.7% (growing 10% annually)
- Revenue Growth: 12% projected FY2024

- **Base Case (45% probability)**: $400 target - Steady cloud growth, successful Copilot rollout
- **Bear Case (20% probability)**: $340 downside - Economic slowdown impacts IT spending, competition intensifies

- Azure growth acceleration expected Q1 2025
- Windows 12 launch (H2 2025) with AI integration
- Activision synergies throughout 2025

**3. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) - Ultimate Defensive Equity**

**Investment Thesis:**
Berkshire Hathaway represents the ultimate defensive equity position - a diversified conglomerate managed by Warren Buffett with a 60-year track record of compounding capital at superior rates. Trading near book value (1.4x) for the first time since 2020, BRK offers asymmetric upside with limited downside risk. The company's $150B+ cash hoard positions it perfectly for opportunistic acquisitions during market dislocations.

The insurance operations generate consistent float for investment, while wholly-owned businesses span defensive industries (utilities, railroads, consumer brands). With Buffett's successor Greg Abel proving capable and the investment team deepening, succession risk is diminishing. BRK essentially offers hedge fund-like active management at zero fee within an equity wrapper.

**Fundamental Metrics:**
- P/B Ratio: 1.42x (near 10-year low of 1.35x)
- No dividend (buyback focused)
- Book Value Growth: 12% CAGR over 20 years
- Operating Earnings: $37B run rate
- Cash Position: $157B (record high)
- Combined Ratio: 95% (profitable underwriting)
- ROE: 13% normalized

**Technical Setup:**
- Current Price: $428.00 (B shares)
- Entry Zone: $425-435
- Support: $420 (recent low), $400 (major)
- Resistance: $440, then $460
- RSI: 45 (mildly oversold)
- Chart Pattern: Basing after correction

**Valuation Analysis:**
- P/B: 1.42x vs 20-year average 1.45x
- Buffett's buyback threshold: ~1.2x book
- Sum-of-parts valuation: $480+ per B share
- Normalized P/E: ~20x operating earnings

**Trade Structure:**
- Entry Price Range: $426-432
- Target Price: $475 (10% upside)
- Stretch Target: $500 (16% upside)
- Stop Loss: $400 (-7% from $428)
- Position Size: 6% of portfolio (~14 shares)
- Holding Period: Long-term (2+ years)

**Risk/Reward Scenarios:**
- **Bull Case (25% probability)**: $520 target - Major acquisition deployed, hard market in insurance
- **Base Case (55% probability)**: $475 target - Steady compounding, buybacks continue
- **Bear Case (20% probability)**: $400 downside - Recession impacts operating businesses

**Catalyst Timeline:**
- Q4 2024 results (February 2025)
- Annual letter release (late February 2025)
- Potential acquisition announcements (ongoing)
- Insurance pricing cycle (2025-2026)

**4. AbbVie (ABBV) - High-Yield Pharma Value**

**Investment Thesis:**
AbbVie offers a compelling combination of high yield (4.4%), discounted valuation (10x P/E), and successful Humira replacement strategy. While Humira's patent expiration created headline risk, management's proactive diversification into Skyrizi/Rinvoq (immunology) and recent acquisitions position ABBV for return to growth by 2025. The market's excessive pessimism creates opportunity for patient capital.

With $18B in annual free cash flow supporting the dividend (60% payout ratio), ABBV offers one of the highest secure yields in the S&P 100. The aesthetics portfolio (Botox) provides stable, non-reimbursed revenue streams. Trading at half the market multiple despite strong fundamentals represents deep value in quality healthcare.

**Fundamental Metrics:**
- P/E Ratio: 10.2x forward (vs peer avg 16x)
- Dividend Yield: 4.4% (well-covered)
- Revenue Growth: -6% 2024E, +5% 2025E (inflection)
- Operating Margin: 36%
- Free Cash Flow: $18B annually
- Net Debt/EBITDA: 2.8x (manageable)
- Pipeline: 50+ programs in development

**Technical Setup:**
- Current Price: $172.50
- Entry Zone: $170-175
- Support: $168 (52-week low), $160
- Resistance: $180, $185
- RSI: 38 (oversold)
- Pattern: Double bottom forming

**Trade Structure:**
- Entry Range: $171-174
- Target: $190 (10% upside + dividend)
- Stop Loss: $162 (-6.4%)
- Position Size: 3% of portfolio (~17 shares)

**Risk/Reward Scenarios:**
- **Bull Case (30%)**: $200 - Growth inflection earlier than expected
- **Base Case (50%)**: $190 - Steady transition, dividend growth
- **Bear Case (20%)**: $160 - Biosimilar erosion worse than modeled

**5. Chevron (CVX) - Energy Sector Defense**

**Investment Thesis:**
Chevron offers defensive energy exposure with best-in-class capital discipline and shareholder returns. Trading at 12x earnings with a 4.1% yield, CVX provides inflation protection and geopolitical hedge within a diversified portfolio. Unlike peers, Chevron's low breakeven costs ($50/barrel) ensure profitability across commodity cycles.

The Permian Basin position drives low-cost production growth while downstream integration provides stability. With $15B+ in annual buybacks plus growing dividends, total shareholder returns approach 10% annually at current valuations. ESG pressures create technical selling unrelated to fundamentals.

**Fundamental Metrics:**
- P/E: 12.3x forward (below 15x average)
- Dividend Yield: 4.1% (secure at $50 oil)
- FCF Yield: 8.2% at $75 oil
- ROCE: 18% (industry-leading)
- Breakeven: $50/barrel
- Net Debt/EBITDA: 0.2x

**Technical Setup:**
- Current Price: $152.00
- Entry Zone: $150-154
- Support: $148, $145
- Resistance: $157, $162
- RSI: 42

**Trade Structure:**
- Entry: $151-153
- Target: $165 (8.6% + dividend)
- Stop: $144 (-5.3%)
- Position Size: 2.5% of portfolio

**6. Home Depot (HD) - Housing Recovery Play**

**Investment Thesis:**
Home Depot is positioned to benefit from the eventual housing market recovery as the undisputed home improvement leader. Currently depressed by high mortgage rates impacting existing home sales, HD trades at a discounted 20x P/E versus its 24x historical average. As the Fed eventually pivots and housing activity normalizes, HD offers significant operating leverage.

With 90% market share in pro customer segment and industry-leading margins, competitive advantages remain intact. Management's focus on digital integration and supply chain efficiency drives share gains. The 2.7% dividend grows consistently while buybacks shrink share count 2-3% annually.

**Fundamental Metrics:**
- P/E: 20.4x (vs 24x 5-year avg)
- Dividend Yield: 2.7%
- Same-store sales: -3% (temporary headwind)
- Operating Margin: 14.5%
- ROIC: 35%+
- FCF: $15B+ annually

**Technical Setup:**
- Current Price: $332.00
- Entry Zone: $328-335
- Support: $325, $310
- Resistance: $340, $355

**Trade Structure:**
- Entry: $330-334
- Target: $365 (10% upside)
- Stop: $315 (-5.2%)
- Position Size: 3% of portfolio

**7. Colgate-Palmolive (CL) - Defensive Consumer Staple**

**Investment Thesis:**
Colgate represents a pure defensive play with 80%+ market share in toothpaste across many emerging markets. Trading at reasonable valuations with a 3% yield, CL offers stability and inflation protection through pricing power. Recent innovations in premium oral care and pet nutrition drive mix improvement.

The company's emerging market exposure (50%+ of sales) provides long-term growth as middle classes expand. With 60+ consecutive years of dividend increases, CL epitomizes consistent compounding. Recent weakness from currency headwinds creates entry opportunity.

**Fundamental Metrics:**
- P/E: 22x forward (below 25x average)
- Dividend Yield: 2.9%
- Organic Growth: 4-5%
- Operating Margin: 22% (expanding)
- ROCE: 85%+ (asset-light model)

**Trade Structure:**
- Entry: $78-80
- Target: $86 (8.8% upside)
- Stop: $74 (-6.3%)
- Position Size: 2% of portfolio

**8. NextEra Energy (NEE) - Renewable Utility Leader**

**Investment Thesis:**
NextEra combines utility stability with renewable energy growth, offering defensive characteristics plus secular tailwinds. As the largest renewable developer in North America, NEE benefits from the energy transition mega-trend. Trading at discounted valuations due to interest rate concerns despite strong fundamentals.

The regulated utility base in Florida provides steady cash flows while the renewable development arm drives 10%+ earnings growth. With AI data center power demand exploding, NEE's clean generation assets become increasingly valuable. The 3.8% yield grows 10% annually.

**Fundamental Metrics:**
- P/E: 17x forward (vs 20x average)
- Dividend Yield: 3.8%
- Rate Base Growth: 8-10%
- Renewable Backlog: 22GW
- Credit Rating: A-

**Trade Structure:**
- Entry: $74-76
- Target: $84 (12% upside)
- Stop: $70 (-5.3%)
- Position Size: 3% of portfolio

## 5. SECTOR ALLOCATION STRATEGY

**Current Portfolio Sector Weights:**
- Healthcare: 42.2% (significantly overweight due to MRK)
- Technology: 15.6% (AAPL, COST)
- Financials: 8.6% (JPM)
- Consumer Staples: 8.8% (WMT, KO, PG)
- Industrials: 6.7% (LMT)
- Communication Services: 3.9% (VZ)
- Utilities: 0% (key gap)
- Energy: 0% (consideration for diversification)

**Target Sector Allocation for Defensive Positioning:**
- Healthcare: 25-30% (reduce concentration)
- Consumer Staples: 15-20% (increase defensive exposure)
- Utilities: 10-15% (add for stability)
- Technology: 15-20% (quality names only)
- Financials: 10-15% (maintain)
- Industrials: 5-10% (selective exposure)
- Energy: 5% (inflation hedge)
- REITs: 0-5% (interest rate sensitive)

**Defensive Sector Opportunities:**

**Healthcare Rebalancing:**
The current 42% healthcare weight (driven by oversized MRK position) requires immediate attention. Trimming MRK by 50% and rotating into diversified healthcare names like JNJ and ABBV would improve risk-adjusted returns while maintaining sector exposure to defensive pharma characteristics.

**Utility Sector Addition:**
The portfolio's lack of utility exposure represents a key gap in defensive positioning. Adding NEE or traditional regulated utilities like Southern Company (SO) or Dominion (D) would provide:
- Bond-proxy characteristics with growth
- Inflation protection through regulated rate increases
- Lower correlation to broader market
- AI/data center power demand tailwinds

**Consumer Staples Expansion:**
Current 8.8% weighting should increase to 15-20% through additions of:
- Colgate-Palmolive (CL): Global oral care dominance
- General Mills (GIS): Packaged food with pricing power
- Kimberly-Clark (KMB): Personal care essentials
These names offer 3-4% yields with consistent dividend growth.

**Quality Factor Screening Results:**
Screening S&P 100 for quality defensive characteristics (ROE >20%, stable margins, low debt):
1. Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) - Healthcare
2. Procter & Gamble (PG) - Staples
3. Coca-Cola (KO) - Staples
4. Microsoft (MSFT) - Technology
5. Visa (V) - Financials
6. Colgate-Palmolive (CL) - Staples

**Dividend Aristocrats Analysis:**
S&P 100 members with 25+ years of consecutive dividend increases:
- Trading at attractive valuations: JNJ, ABBV, CVX, CL
- Fairly valued: PG, KO, PEP, WMT
- Expensive but quality: COST, MSFT

**Recession-Resistant Positioning:**
To prepare for potential economic slowdown:
1. Increase staples and utilities to 35% combined
2. Focus on companies with pricing power
3. Emphasize strong balance sheets (net cash or low leverage)
4. Avoid cyclical consumer discretionary
5. Consider treasury allocation if yields exceed 5%

## 7. RISK MANAGEMENT & MONITORING

**Portfolio Risk Metrics Post-Trades:**
- Projected Beta: 0.93 (slight decrease from 0.95)
- Largest Position: MRK at 15.4% (down from 30.8%)
- Sector Concentration: Healthcare 28% (improved from 42%)
- Dividend Yield: 2.6% (up from 2.3%)
- Quality Score: 8.5/10 (improved diversification)
- Number of Positions: 13 (up from 10)

**Correlation Analysis:**
Key correlation considerations post-rebalancing:
- Healthcare exposure more diversified (JNJ vs MRK correlation: 0.65)
- Utility addition (NEE) provides negative correlation to growth stocks
- Staples expansion (PG) reduces economic sensitivity
- BRK.B adds uncorrelated active management overlay
- Overall portfolio correlation to S&P 500: ~0.85

**Downside Protection Strategy:**
1. **Stop Loss Discipline**: All new positions have -7% stops
2. **Position Sizing**: No position exceeds 15% (MRK reduced)
3. **Quality Focus**: Emphasis on investment-grade balance sheets
4. **Dividend Buffer**: 2.6% yield provides income cushion
5. **Cash Reserve**: Maintaining 2-3% cash for opportunities

**Key Monitoring Points:**
- **Daily**: Major position moves >3%, news alerts
- **Weekly**: Beta drift calculation, sector weights
- **Monthly**: Fundamental updates, earnings reviews
- **Quarterly**: Full rebalancing assessment

**Trigger Points for Action:**
1. **Beta Drift**: If portfolio beta exceeds 1.10 or falls below 0.80
2. **Position Concentration**: Any position exceeding 15%
3. **Fundamental Deterioration**: Credit downgrades, dividend cuts
4. **Technical Breaks**: Stop loss violations
5. **Macro Shifts**: Fed policy pivot, recession indicators

**Weekly Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Calculate current portfolio beta
- [ ] Review largest winners/losers
- [ ] Check earnings calendar for holdings
- [ ] Monitor sector rotation trends
- [ ] Assess cash level and deployment opportunities
- [ ] Update stop losses for winning positions
- [ ] Screen for new defensive opportunities
- [ ] Review correlation matrix for concentration risk

**Risk Scenario Planning:**
- **10% Market Correction**: Portfolio expected to decline 8-9% (beta <1)
- **Sector Rotation to Cyclicals**: Underperform but protect capital
- **Interest Rate Spike**: NEE and utilities pressured, offset by financials
- **Recession**: Defensive positioning should outperform significantly
- **Inflation Surge**: Pricing power of staples provides protection

**Performance Monitoring vs SHORGAN-BOT:**
While competing against the aggressive SHORGAN-BOT strategy:
- Focus on risk-adjusted returns (Sharpe ratio)
- Emphasize lower volatility and drawdowns
- Track rolling 3-month performance comparisons
- Document capital preservation during market stress
- Maintain discipline despite potential underperformance in bull markets

---

**CONCLUSION:**

This comprehensive analysis identifies clear opportunities to improve DEE-BOT's defensive positioning while maintaining competitive returns. The immediate priority is reducing MRK concentration risk and deploying capital into high-quality dividend aristocrats trading at attractive valuations. The addition of utility exposure and expansion of consumer staples creates a more resilient portfolio prepared for various economic scenarios. With disciplined execution of these trades, DEE-BOT will achieve better diversification, higher yield, and improved downside protection while staying true to its capital preservation mandate.

## 1. MARKET ENVIRONMENT & CATALYST LANDSCAPE

### Current Market Regime Analysis
The November catalyst window has opened with heightened volatility as we navigate Q3 earnings season's final stretch. Small-cap stocks ($1B-$10B market cap) are showing increased momentum divergence, creating ideal conditions for catalyst-driven trades. The VIX has stabilized around 18-20, indicating moderate volatility that favors nimble traders with smaller accounts.

Key market dynamics favoring our $2K account strategy:
- Small-cap earnings beats are generating 15-30% moves (vs 5-10% for large-caps)
- Biotech sector heating up with year-end FDA decision calendar
- Retail earnings providing binary opportunities in affordable stocks
- Tech earnings winding down, shifting focus to overlooked sectors

### Catalyst Environment for Small Accounts
The current environment is exceptionally favorable for accounts under $5K:
- Increased retail participation creating momentum in sub-$20 stocks
- Options flow telegraphing catalyst moves in affordable names
- Lower institutional coverage on $500M-$5B companies = bigger surprises
- November historically strong for small-cap outperformance

### Liquidity Conditions
Critical for our account size:
- Small-cap liquidity remains robust with >$1M daily volume on most watchlist names
- Bid-ask spreads tightening on catalyst stocks as event dates approach
- Pre-market and after-hours volume increasing on earnings names
- Retail-friendly brokers maintaining tight spreads on popular stocks

### Risk Environment Assessment
Current risk factors for small account management:
- Overnight gaps remain elevated (5-10% common on catalysts)
- Sector rotation happening quickly (2-3 day cycles)
- Stop losses getting hunted in volatile names
- News-driven volatility increasing into year-end

### Opportunity Set Analysis
Prime hunting ground for $2K accounts this week:
- Biotech FDA decisions (5 major ones in next 14 days)
- Small-cap tech earnings (30+ companies reporting)
- Retail earnings creating 20%+ moves
- Cannabis stocks moving on state ballot initiatives
- Energy names volatile on geopolitical tensions

## 5. POSITION MANAGEMENT FOR SMALL ACCOUNTS

### Immediate Actions Required

**Positions to Consider Exiting:**
None currently - both FUBO and RVMD have imminent catalysts worth holding through. FUBO earnings Thursday could provide 20%+ move. RVMD data by 11/15 offers biotech upside.

**New Position Deployment Strategy:**
With $1,847 cash available, optimal deployment:
1. Tonight (11/5): Enter APPS and PAYO before earnings - $200 total
2. Tomorrow (11/6): Add LYFT position before earnings - $100
3. Thursday (11/7): Enter PTON before Friday open - $100
4. Friday (11/8): Deploy into RXRX if FDA catalyst pending - $100

This deploys $500-600 while maintaining cash buffer for opportunities.

### Profit-Taking Rules for $2K Account
- At +20% gain: Sell 1/3 to 1/2 position
- At +35% gain: Sell another 1/3, trail stop remainder
- At +50% gain: Take most off table, keep 10-20% moon shot
- Never let winner turn to loser - trail stops after +15%

### Stop Loss Discipline
Absolute rules for capital preservation:
- Initial stop: 15% maximum on all positions
- Trailing stop: Activate at +10% gain, trail by 10%
- Earnings stops: Widen to 18% for binary events
- Time stop: Exit if catalyst doesn't play within timeframe

### Cash Management Strategy
- Minimum cash buffer: $400-500 (20-25% of account)
- After wins: Let cash build before redeploying
- After losses: Take 24 hours before new trades
- Max deployment: Never exceed 80% invested

### Rebalancing Triggers
- Any position exceeding $300 (15% of account): Trim
- Winning streak (3+ wins): Reduce position sizes
- Losing streak (2+ losses): Step back, reassess
- Monthly rebalance: First Monday of month

### Psychological Risk Management
- Celebrate wins but stay humble (market will humble you)

2. Review position correlations (avoid concentration)
3. Check catalyst calendar for binary event clustering  
4. Ensure 20%+ cash buffer maintained
