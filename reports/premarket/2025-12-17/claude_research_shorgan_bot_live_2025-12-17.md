## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

**Current Market Levels (December 16, 2025)**:

- **SPY Commentary**: $677.36 - Near all-time highs. Strong bull market continues with narrow bid/ask spreads ($0.02). Support at $670, resistance at $680. Momentum remains bullish despite elevated valuations.

- **QQQ Commentary**: $608.99 - Tech sector leading with new highs. Magnificent 7 driving performance. AI narrative remains strong. Technical breakout above $600 confirms uptrend.

- **IWM Commentary**: $249.68 - Small-caps lagging at 249.68 vs large-cap strength. This divergence creates opportunity in oversold small-cap catalysts. Key support at $245.

- **Macro Events This Week**:
  - Wednesday Dec 18: FOMC Meeting Minutes (2:00 PM)
  - Thursday Dec 19: Q3 GDP Final (8:30 AM)
  - Thursday Dec 19: Initial Jobless Claims
  - Friday Dec 20: PCE Inflation Data (8:30 AM)

- **Catalyst-Rich Sectors**: 
  - Biotech (FDA year-end approvals)
  - Software (Q4 earnings pre-announcements)
  - EV/Clean Energy (year-end production reports)
  - Retail (holiday sales updates)

- **Volatility Regime**: VIX data unavailable but SPY's $0.02 spread indicates extremely low volatility. Options premiums likely compressed - unfavorable for buyers.
