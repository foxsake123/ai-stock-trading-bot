- **Beta Management**: Portfolio beta ~1.03, within target range
- **Consolidation Needed**: 20 positions vs. 12 target - requires trimming

**Top 3 Conviction Ideas:**
1. **EXIT CVX**: Energy sector weakness, small position, free up capital
2. **TRIM WMT**: Take profits after 13% gain, reduce to 5% weight
3. **ADD CSCO**: Defensive tech play at attractive valuation ($77.82)

**Macro Assessment:**

**Federal Reserve Policy:**
- Current Fed Funds: 4.50-4.75%
- December 17 FOMC: 94% probability of 25bp cut priced in

2. **Earnings**: Q4 2025 earnings season starts January 2026
3. **Technical**: S&P 500 testing resistance at 6,050
4. **Seasonal**: Year-end tax loss selling could pressure losers

**Portfolio Strategy This Week:**
- Reduce position count from 20 to 15 (exit weakest 5)
- Lock in gains on extended winners (WMT, BMY partial trims)
- Rotate into quality dividend growers trading at reasonable valuations
- Maintain defensive tilt heading into FOMC

## 10. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Portfolio Risk Metrics:**
- **Portfolio Beta**: 1.03 (within target range 0.85-1.15)
- **Max Single Position**: 7.3% (JPM/WMT - being reduced to 5%)
- **Cash Level**: 3.3% ($3,385 after trades)
- **Stop Loss Compliance**: All new positions have 8% stops
- **Position Count**: Reduced from 20 to 17 (moving toward 12 target)

**Risk Controls in Place:**
1. **Position Sizing**: No position exceeds 10% of portfolio
2. **Stop Losses**: Hard 8% stops on all new entries
3. **Sector Limits**: No sector exceeds 25% of portfolio
4. **Quality Screen**: Exiting lowest conviction names (CVX, PFE)
5. **Beta Management**: Maintaining defensive tilt with beta near 1.0

**Rebalancing Triggers:**
- Beta drift >0.15 from 1.0 target
- Any position exceeding 10% weight  
- Stop loss hit on any position (-8%)
- Fundamental deterioration in any holding
- Major macro event (FOMC surprise, geopolitical shock)

**Weekly Review Checklist:**
- [✓] Portfolio beta within range (1.03)
- [✓] All positions <10% weight (after WMT trim)
- [✓] Dividend safety check (all secure)
- [✓] Stop losses set on new trades
- [ ] Review December 17 FOMC impact
- [ ] Monitor energy sector for XOM
- [ ] Track CSCO, ABBV, INTC fills

**Key Risks This Week:**
1. **FOMC Decision** (Wed): Hawkish surprise could pressure markets
2. **Triple Witching** (Fri): Increased volatility expected
3. **Year-End Flows**: Tax loss selling may pressure losers
4. **Energy Weakness**: Monitor XOM closely at support
5. **Tech Rotation**: MSFT, AAPL may see profit-taking

**Contingency Plans:**
- If FOMC hawkish: Ready to add more defensives (PG, JNJ)
- If energy breaks down: Exit XOM below $114
- If tech corrects >5%: Add to MSFT on weakness
- If volatility spikes: Hold cash, avoid new entries

## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

**Current Market Levels (December 16, 2025)**:

- **SPY Commentary**: $677.36 - Near all-time highs. Strong bull market continues with narrow bid/ask spreads ($0.02). Support at $670, resistance at $680. Momentum remains bullish despite elevated valuations.

- **QQQ Commentary**: $608.99 - Tech sector leading with new highs. Magnificent 7 driving performance. AI narrative remains strong. Technical breakout above $600 confirms uptrend.

- **IWM Commentary**: $249.68 - Small-caps lagging at 249.68 vs large-cap strength. This divergence creates opportunity in oversold small-cap catalysts. Key support at $245.

- **Macro Events This Week**:
  - Wednesday Dec 18: FOMC Meeting Minutes (2:00 PM)
  - Thursday Dec 19: Q3 GDP Final (8:30 AM)
  - Thursday Dec 19: Initial Jobless Claims
  - Friday Dec 20: PCE Inflation Data (8:30 AM)

- **Catalyst-Rich Sectors**: 
  - Biotech (FDA year-end approvals)
  - Software (Q4 earnings pre-announcements)
  - EV/Clean Energy (year-end production reports)
  - Retail (holiday sales updates)

- **Volatility Regime**: VIX data unavailable but SPY's $0.02 spread indicates extremely low volatility. Options premiums likely compressed - unfavorable for buyers.
