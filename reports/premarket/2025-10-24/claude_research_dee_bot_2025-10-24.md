# DEE-BOT Weekly Deep Research Report
**Date:** October 23, 2025 | **Week 8** | **Portfolio Value:** $102,734.19

## 1. Current Portfolio Assessment

- **Cash Position:** $48,999.58 (47.7% - significantly overweight)
- **Number of Holdings:** 10 positions
- **Total P&L:** +$1,279.15 (+2.53% since inception)

### Quality Scores by Position
| Ticker | Weight | Beta | Quality Score | Assessment |
|--------|--------|------|--------------|------------|
| AAPL | 16.4% | 1.25 | A+ | Strong fundamentals, slight overweight |
| JPM | 15.4% | 1.15 | A | Quality financials leader, appropriate weight |
| UNH | 14.7% | 0.85 | A+ | Healthcare defensive, strong moat |
| MRK | 14.6% | 0.70 | A | Pharma defensive, solid dividends |
| LMT | 12.7% | 0.85 | A- | Defense contractor, stable earnings |
| COST | 12.3% | 0.75 | A+ | Recession-resistant retail |
| WMT | 8.9% | 0.70 | A+ | Consumer defensive champion |
| KO | 2.1% | 0.60 | A | Underweight position needs scaling |
| VZ | 1.8% | 0.50 | B+ | Telecom defensive, underweight |
| PG | 1.1% | 0.60 | A+ | Consumer staples leader, severely underweight |

### Risk Exposure Analysis
- **Sector Concentration:** Well-diversified across Tech, Healthcare, Financials, Consumer sectors
- **Single Stock Risk:** AAPL slightly overweight at 16.4%
- **Cash Drag:** 47.7% cash position severely impacting returns

## 2. Beta Drift Analysis

**Current Portfolio Beta: 0.90 vs Target: 1.00**
- **Drift: -0.10** (within 0.15 threshold)
- **Rebalancing Required:** YES - Not for beta drift, but for cash deployment

The portfolio's defensive tilt (beta 0.90) is acceptable, but the massive cash position (47.7%) is creating significant performance drag. With markets performing well, maintaining nearly half the portfolio in cash contradicts our mandate to stay ~97% invested.

## 3. Rebalancing Recommendations

### Priority Actions:
1. **Deploy $45,000 of cash** to reach ~3% cash target
2. **Scale up underweight quality positions** (PG, KO, VZ)
3. **Add 1-2 new S&P 100 quality names** to improve diversification

### Recommended Additions:
- **Scale PG from 4 to 50 shares** (+46 shares): Premier consumer defensive
- **Scale KO from 16 to 80 shares** (+64 shares): Dividend aristocrat
- **Add new position: JNJ** (40 shares): Healthcare blue-chip, Beta ~0.70
- **Add new position: MSFT** (25 shares): Quality tech, Beta ~1.20
