## 5. RISK AND LIQUIDITY CHECKS

### POSITION SIZING:
- Total short exposure: -$54,806 (manageable with margin)
- Largest position: UNH at $15,099 (14.5% of portfolio)
- Options exposure limited to $2,800 (2.7% of portfolio)

### LIQUIDITY ANALYSIS:
- All positions have >300K daily volume except RGTI (extreme volume)
- Spread risk minimal on large-caps, monitor KRYS spreads
- Short borrow availability confirmed on SMCI

### CORRELATION RISK:
- Quantum names (RGTI/IONQ) inversely correlated - natural hedge
- Energy shorts (CVX/CIVI) correlated - monitor combined exposure
- Tech concentration manageable at 25% of portfolio

## 6. MONITORING PLAN

### DAILY WATCH (Pre-Market):
1. **SMCI**: Check for any 8-K filings, auditor news
2. **KRYS**: FDA calendar updates, AdCom news
3. **FUBO**: Analyst downgrades, subscriber estimates

### CATALYST ALERTS SET:
- Oct 29: FUBO earnings (exit by Oct 28)
- Oct 31: ARWR earnings (position review)
- Nov 4: INCY PDUFA (hold through event)
- Nov 8: KRYS FDA decision (binary event)
- Nov 15: VKTX data release (options expiry Nov 22)

### TECHNICAL TRIGGERS:
- **IONQ**: Cover if breaks above $68 (20-day high)
- **RGTI**: Sell remaining if drops below $35 (25% pullback)
- **SMCI**: Add to short below $47 (breakdown confirmation)
- **CVX**: Cover on break above $162 (resistance)

### STOP LOSS REVIEWS:
- Trailing stops on all winners >10% profit
- Hard stops on new positions per order blocks
- Weekly review of short borrow rates

**COMPETITIVE EDGE**: While DEE-BOT likely focuses on traditional momentum, we're exploiting binary catalyst events with defined risk through options, aggressive shorts on broken stories (SMCI), and FDA catalysts that create 40-100% moves. Our 30-day timeframe advantage allows us to capture these high-probability setups.
