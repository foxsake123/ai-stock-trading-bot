- **TURNING**: Crypto miners (MARA, RIOT flat) - Bitcoin momentum fading

**Key Market Themes:**
1. **Earnings Season**: February 2026 Q4'25 earnings wrapping up - tech disappointments
2. **Fed Watch**: March 2026 FOMC meeting in 5 weeks - rate cut pause likely
3. **China Tech**: Continued regulatory pressure weighing on ADRs
4. **Energy**: Oil strength on Middle East tensions, CVX short bleeding
5. **Crypto**: Bitcoin consolidation around $45K weighing on miners

## 12. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Portfolio Guidelines:**
- **Max Position**: $10,000 (10% of capital) ✓
- **Max Sector**: 25% concentration - MONITOR tech at 23%
- **Stop Loss Rules**: 10% stocks, 12% shorts - CVX hit stop
- **Options Limit**: 20% of portfolio - Currently 0%
- **Cash Target**: $15,000-$25,000 - Will have $25,234 after exits
- **MARGIN FLOOR**: Cash above -$30,000 ✓
- **Daily Loss Limit**: $5,000 - Room for volatility
- **MAX POSITIONS**: 15-20 total - Reducing from 17 to 14
- **MIN CONVICTION**: 7/10 for new entries - NVDA 8.5, MSFT 7.0 ✓

**Risk Monitoring:**
1. NVDA earnings binary risk - sized appropriately at 5%
2. Energy exposure reducing from 7.1% to 3.6%
3. Removing highest risk positions (DKNG, AMZN)
4. Cash buffer restored to target range
5. Portfolio count optimized to 14 high-conviction names

**Contingency Plans:**
- If NVDA gaps down >10% on earnings: Stop at $179
- If market breaks SPY $670: Activate put hedges
- If margin approaches -$20K: Emergency exits on lowest conviction

---

**DAILY SUMMARY**: Decisive rebalancing day. Cutting losers (AMZN -16.7%, DKNG weak), covering failed short (CVX), and banking winners (OXY +14.6%). Consolidating into highest conviction plays ahead of NVDA earnings catalyst. Cash position restored to $25K+ for flexibility. Portfolio trimmed to 14 quality positions from 17. Ready for next week's earnings catalysts with clean, focused book.
