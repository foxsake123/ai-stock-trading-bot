## 8. SHORT OPPORTUNITIES

**NOTE: SHORGAN-LIVE is a CASH ACCOUNT - SHORTING IS NOT AVAILABLE**

Since we cannot short in a cash account, I'll identify bearish setups to AVOID:

### CVNA - Carvana (AVOID)

**Bearish Thesis**: Trading at $344.18, massively overextended after 1,000%+ rally from lows. Used car prices declining, high interest rates pressuring subprime buyers. Lockup expiration for recent debt-to-equity conversion coming March 15.

**Alternative Play**: Consider PUT options if you have options approval, or simply avoid long positions.

### UPST - Upstart Holdings (AVOID)

**Bearish Thesis**: AI lending platform struggling with loan performance. Trading at $30.18 after falling from $400+ highs. Bank partners pulling back, default rates rising. No clear catalyst for recovery.

---
