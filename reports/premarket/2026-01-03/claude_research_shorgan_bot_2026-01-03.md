## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT & CATALYST LANDSCAPE

**Market Regime**: NEUTRAL RISK with bullish bias

**Index Analysis**:
- **SPY**: $681.02 (-0.20% day) - consolidating near ATHs at $691
- **QQQ**: $611.58 - tech holding steady, quantum names volatile
- **IWM**: $247.29 - small caps showing relative strength
- **VIX**: ~13-15 (low volatility = complacency = opportunity)

**Sector Momentum**:
- **HOT**: Quantum computing (RGTI, IONQ), Energy (OXY, RIG), Healthcare catalysts
- **COLD**: EV names (RIVN worst), Software (DOCU, ZM struggling)
- **TURNING**: Solar (ENPH breaking out), Fintech (SOFI momentum)

**Macro Calendar Next 14 Days**:
- **January 6**: ISM Services PMI (10:00 AM)
- **January 8**: FOMC Minutes (2:00 PM) - hawkish risk
- **January 10**: December CPI (8:30 AM) - critical inflation print
- **January 15**: Retail Sales, PPI data
- **January 16**: Bank earnings kickoff (JPM, WFC, C)

**Options Flow Observations**:
- Heavy call buying in quantum names (RGTI, IONQ)
- Unusual put volume in ABNB (good for our short)
- Biotech call skew elevated (earnings season approaching)

**Short Interest Catalysts**:
- CIVI: 18% short interest, earnings January 28
- PATH: 22% short interest, potential squeeze risk
- PLUG: 15% short interest, hydrogen momentum building

**Bottom Line**: Aggressive rebalancing into HIGH-CONVICTION catalyst plays. Taking massive profits in ARWR/ARQT, cutting losers in RIVN, and rotating into JPM healthcare conference winners. The next two weeks are CATALYST RICH - execute with precision and discipline.

**Fortune favors the bold, but only with stop losses.**
