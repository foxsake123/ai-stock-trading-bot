## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

- **SPY Commentary**: Currently near $600 level, approaching year-end with reduced volume. Support at $595, resistance at $605. Low-volatility drift higher continues.

- **QQQ Commentary**: Tech showing relative strength, $518 level holding. Mega-cap tech leading, small-cap tech lagging. Momentum names like SOFI, ROKU showing strength.

- **IWM Commentary**: Small-caps at $225 level, underperforming large-caps. This is critical for our universe - watch for rotation opportunities.

- **Macro Events This Week**: 
  - December 26 (Today): Half-day trading, low volume
  - December 27-29: Markets closed for weekend
  - December 30-31: Year-end positioning, tax-loss selling
  - January 2, 2026: First trading day of new year
  - January 8, 2026: December payrolls report

- **Catalyst-Rich Sectors**: 
  - Biotech: January PDUFA dates, JPM Healthcare Conference (Jan 13-16)
  - Fintech: Q4 earnings season starting mid-January
  - EV/Tech: CES 2026 (Jan 7-10) catalyst

- **Volatility Regime**: VIX at 13-15 level indicates complacency. Options premiums cheap for long strategies.

- **IV Rank Context**: Market-wide IV in 20th percentile. Favorable for option buyers ahead of January catalysts.

## 11. RISK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

**Daily Loss Limit**: $300 (10% of portfolio)
- Current unrealized P&L: +$199
- Buffer before limit: $499
- If -$200 intraday → Reduce all new position sizes by 50%

- Options: 50% of premium ($120 on VKTX, $127 on RIVN)
- Shorts: 18% stop on NKLA ($4.13 from $3.50 entry)

**Position Sizing Guardrails:**
- Min position: $75 ✓ (all new positions > $250)
- Max position: $300 ✓ (SOUN at $306 is borderline)
- Max single stock: 12% ✓ (post-rebalance all under 10%)
- Max sector concentration: 30% ✓ (biotech at 24% post-trim)

**Cash Buffer Target**: $400-$600
- Post-rebalance cash: $459 ✓
- Sufficient for margin requirements and opportunities

**Options Exposure Limit**: 15% of portfolio ($450 max)
- Current options exposure: $495 (16.4%) - SLIGHTLY OVER
- Consider reducing RIVN spread to 2 contracts if needed

**Weekly Review Triggers:**
- Portfolio +6.6% currently - no issues
- DNLI/PRTA showing "BROKEN" thesis - EXITING
- No positions at -20% threshold

**Year-End Specific Risks:**
- Low liquidity Dec 30-31 - use limit orders only
- Tax-loss selling could pressure weak names
- Window dressing by institutions
- January effect could boost small-caps
