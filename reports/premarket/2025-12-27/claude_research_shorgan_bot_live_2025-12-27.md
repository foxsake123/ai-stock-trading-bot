## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW- **SPY Commentary**: Current level: $690.46. Markets remain elevated post-Fed December meeting. Support at $680, resistance at $695. Holiday week trading showing typical low volume patterns.

- **QQQ Commentary**: Tech sector momentum strong at $624.14. NASDAQ continues to outperform, driven by AI and semiconductor strength. Key support at $615.

- **IWM Commentary**: Small-caps at $251.52, showing relative weakness versus large-caps. This is our primary hunting ground for catalyst plays - increased volatility creates opportunities.

  - December 31: Chicago PMI (Tuesday, early close)
  - January 3: December ISM Manufacturing PMI (critical)
  - January 6: December ISM Services PMI
  - January 10: December CPI data (major catalyst)

- **Catalyst-Rich Sectors**: 
  - Biotech: Multiple PDUFA dates in January
  - Earnings: Banks kick off Q4 season January 15
  - Small-cap tech: Year-end momentum plays

- **Volatility Regime**: VIX around 14 (low). Options premiums compressed, favoring stock plays over options for now.

- **IV Rank Context**: Market-wide IV in 25th percentile. Wait for volatility expansion before aggressive options plays.
