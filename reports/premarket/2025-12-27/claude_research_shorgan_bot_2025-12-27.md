## 12. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Portfolio Risk Metrics:**
- **Max Single Position**: $10,000 (Currently violating with ZM!)
- **Max Sector Concentration**: 25% (Tech at 35% - REDUCE)
- **Stop Loss Discipline**: 12% long positions, 15% short positions
- **Options Allocation**: 15% max (Currently 0% - UNDERUTILIZED)
- **Cash Buffer Target**: $15,000-$25,000 (Will achieve post-rebalancing)
- **Daily Loss Limit**: $5,000 hard stop

**Risk Monitoring Dashboard:**
- VaR (95% confidence): $8,250 daily
- Beta-weighted exposure: 1.15 vs SPY
- Correlation risk: High tech concentration
- Liquidity risk: All positions liquid
- Short squeeze monitoring: CVX, DAKT biggest risks

**Contingency Plans:**
- If SPY breaks 680: Reduce longs by 25%
- If VIX spikes >18: Close all shorts
- If account drops below $105k: Go to 50% cash
- If oil rallies >5%: Cover energy shorts

**CRITICAL ACTIONS FOR MONDAY:**
1. Execute ZM reduction FIRST - this frees up $26k
2. Close all winning shorts - bank profits
3. Deploy capital into January catalyst plays
4. Maintain stop discipline on all new entries

This portfolio is overextended and underperforming. Time to clean house, raise cash, and position for the January catalyst bonanza. The market's giving us a gift with these year-end levels - let's not waste it.

Remember: We're not investors, we're CATALYST TRADERS. If there's no event in the next 14 days, we don't care. Focus on the highest probability setups with defined risk/reward.

Target by year-end: 22 positions max, $20k cash buffer, positioned for January volatility expansion.

Let's fucking GO! 🚀
