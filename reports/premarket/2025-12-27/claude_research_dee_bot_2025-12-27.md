- **Best**: Technology (+1.8%), Consumer Staples (+1.2%)
- **Worst**: Energy (-2.1%), Real Estate (-1.8%)

## 10. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Portfolio Metrics Post-Rebalancing:**
- **Portfolio Beta**: 1.01 (within target range 0.85-1.15)
- **Max Single Position**: BAC reduced to 8.0%
- **Cash Buffer**: $1,734.60 (1.7% - still below 3% target)
- **Dividend Yield**: 3.1% (attractive vs 10Y Treasury 4.4%)
- **Stop Loss Coverage**: All positions have 8% max downside stops

**Risk Monitoring Framework:**

**Systematic Risks:**
- Fed Policy Error: Monitor January FOMC closely
- Earnings Recession: Q4 reports start mid-January
- Geopolitical Events: Energy price spike risk

**Position-Specific Risks:**
- INTC: Turnaround execution risk (stop at $33.50)
- PEP/HD: Consumer weakness (monitor Q4 earnings)
- Energy (CVX/XOM): Oil price volatility

**Daily Review Checklist:**
- [✓] Check portfolio beta (Currently 1.02)
- [✓] Review position weights (BAC needs trim)
- [✓] Assess dividend safety (All secure except INTC watch)
- [✓] Monitor upcoming catalysts (Light week ahead)

**Rebalancing Triggers:**
1. Beta drift >0.15 from 1.0 target
2. Any position exceeding 10% weight
3. Cash falling below 1% of portfolio
4. Thesis break on bottom quintile holdings

**Year-End Considerations:**
- Tax loss harvesting opportunities minimal
- Dividend capture dates for January
- Rebalancing into 2026 defensive stance
- Q4 earnings season positioning

**Next Review Date**: Monday, December 30, 2025
- Half-day Tuesday (New Year's Eve)
- Focus on executing rebalancing trades
- Prepare for January volatility

---

**REPORT CONCLUSION**

DEE-BOT maintains a disciplined, quality-focused approach heading into year-end 2025. The portfolio has delivered steady returns (+1.9%) with low volatility, meeting our capital preservation mandate. The key action is trimming the overweight BAC position and building a cash buffer for flexibility.

With the Fed on pause and markets at all-time highs, we favor defensive positioning through quality dividend aristocrats like JNJ while maintaining broad S&P 100 diversification. Our beta-neutral stance should weather any early 2026 volatility while capturing upside from our quality holdings.

The portfolio's 3.1% dividend yield provides steady income in a 4.4% rate environment, with potential for capital appreciation as the Fed potentially eases in 2026. We remain vigilant on position sizing and ready to rotate into opportunities as they arise.

**Portfolio Grade: B+**
- Strong risk-adjusted returns
- Successful capital preservation
- Action needed on cash buffer
- Well-positioned for 2026
