**Report Summary:**
DEE-BOT's defensive portfolio remains well-positioned with a 1.8% unrealized gain and proper diversification across 18 holdings. Today's rebalancing improves quality by exiting weakening consumer names (PG) and reducing housing exposure (HD) while adding defensive quality through AAPL and KO. The portfolio maintains its low-volatility mandate with beta at 1.03 and appropriate cash reserves of 3.8%. Risk management remains paramount as we navigate the first full trading week of 2026.
