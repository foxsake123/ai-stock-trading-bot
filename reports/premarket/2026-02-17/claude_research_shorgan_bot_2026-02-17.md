- **MIN CONVICTION**: 7/10 required - All new positions meet threshold

**Key Risk Factors This Week**:
1. FOMC Minutes Wednesday - Could shift rate expectations
2. NVDA earnings Thursday - Market bellwether
3. Options expiration Friday - Potential volatility
4. Wide spreads indicating dealer uncertainty

**Stop Loss Discipline**: Three positions exceeded -15% threshold and are being exited immediately. New positions have tighter 5-7% stops given market uncertainty.

**Portfolio Beta**: Reducing with exits of AMZN/DKNG, adding defensive V position. Target beta ~1.1 vs current ~1.3.

---

**Bottom Line**: Cutting the dead weight (AMZN, DKNG, CVX short) to free up $10.5K for higher-conviction catalyst plays. Focus on near-term binary events with defined risk/reward. PANW and COIN earnings next week are the crown jewels - holding for the pop. New adds (TSLA, SOFI, V) all have catalysts within 10 days. This is aggressive catalyst trading at its finest - no bagholding, only momentum and events.
