### BIOTECH BINARY EVENTS

**1. SAVA - Alzheimer's Data Catalyst (November 25 Pre-market)**

**Setup Overview:**
Cassava Sciences presents Phase 3 interim data for simufilam in Alzheimer's disease Monday morning. The company has been controversial but the data is binary - either validating the mechanism or killing the program. With the stock at $2.88, risk/reward favors upside speculation.

The controversy stems from data manipulation allegations that crushed the stock from $100+ to current levels. However, if Monday's independent data shows efficacy, massive short covering could drive a 100%+ move. The FDA has allowed the trial to continue, suggesting some merit.

**Technical Setup:**
- Current price: $2.88 (near 52-week lows)
- Support: $2.50 (absolute floor)
- Resistance: $4.20, then $6.00
- 30-day average volume: 2.5M shares

- Bear case (30% probability): Failed trial, drop to $1.50-2.00

**2. SRPT - DMD Pediatric Data (December 6, 8:00 AM)**

**Setup Overview:**
Sarepta Therapeutics reports pivotal pediatric data for their Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene therapy. This is a major de-risking event after recent approvals in older patients. Pediatric indication would double the addressable market. Stock setting up for breakout above $85.
