## 4. TOP CATALYST OPPORTUNITIES

### OPPORTUNITY #1: SAVA (CASSAVA SCIENCES)
**Setup Overview:**
Cassava Sciences faces a make-or-break FDA decision on November 14th regarding their Alzheimer's drug simufilam. This binary event represents one of the most asymmetric risk/reward setups in biotech. The stock has been beaten down 90% from highs due to data manipulation allegations, but recent third-party validation has shifted sentiment. With 45% short interest, approval would trigger an epic squeeze.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Market cap: $1.2B (down from $5B peak)
- Cash position: $180M (2+ years runway)
- Float: 38M shares (45% short)
- No revenue currently (binary on approval)
- Alzheimer's market: $20B+ addressable

**Technical Setup:**
- Current price: $28.50
- 52-week range: $16.20 - $54.80
- Key support: $25 (must hold)
- Resistance: $35, then $45
- Volume: Averaging 3M shares daily (liquid)

**Catalyst Details:**
- FDA decision: November 14, 2025 (expected after hours)
- Type: Accelerated approval decision
- Trial data: Mixed but improving cognition scores
- FDA panel: Voted 6-3 in favor (positive signal)

**Trade Structure:**
- Entry: $27-29 (scale in)
- Position size: 3% of portfolio
- Target 1: $42 (50% probability)
- Target 2: $58 (25% probability)
- Stop loss: $24 (strict)
- Options overlay: Buy Dec $30 calls for leverage

**Risk/Reward Scenarios:**
- Bull case (40%): FDA approval → $55-65 target in 48 hours
- Base case (30%): Conditional approval → $38-42 consolidation
- Bear case (30%): Rejection → $18-22 (stop loss critical)

### OPPORTUNITY #2: IMVT (IMMUNOVANT)
**Setup Overview:**
Immunovant's PDUFA date on November 15th for their autoimmune drug IMVT-1402 represents a high-conviction catalyst play. Unlike SAVA's controversy, IMVT has clean Phase 3 data showing superiority to standard of care. With Roivant Sciences backing and relatively low short interest (18%), this is a cleaner binary event.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Market cap: $6.1B
- Cash: $450M (well-funded)
- Pipeline: Multiple indications beyond lead drug
- Partner: Roivant (deep pockets)
- Peak sales estimate: $3-5B

**Technical Setup:**
- Current price: $52.30
- 52-week range: $38.50 - $64.20
- Support: $48-50 zone
- Resistance: $58, then $65
- Volume: 2.5M shares average

**Catalyst Details:**
- PDUFA date: November 15, 2025

- Base case (25%): Approval with restrictions → $58-62
- Bear case (10%): Delay/CRL → $42-45

### OPPORTUNITY #3: FUBO SHORT SQUEEZE
**Setup Overview:**
FuboTV's November 12th conference call could ignite a massive short squeeze. With 38% short interest, any positive surprise on subscriber growth or partnership announcements would force covering. The streaming consolidation theme and sports betting integration provide multiple catalysts.

- Cash burn: $80M/quarter (improving)
- Subscribers: 1.5M (growing 25% YoY)

### OPPORTUNITY #4: AKRO OBESITY DATA

Akero Therapeutics reports Phase 2b obesity data on November 14th, positioned to capitalize on the GLP-1 mania. Their oral small molecule approach could disrupt injectables. With NASH data already positive, obesity success would transform valuation.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Market cap: $3.2B
- Cash: $320M
- Pipeline: NASH + obesity
- Competition: Going after Ozempic market
- Oral advantage: Huge if effective

**Technical Setup:**

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Market cap: $900M (was $15B)
- Cash concerns addressed with Sanofi deal
- Combination vaccine: First-mover advantage
- Current revenue: $500M annually

**Technical Setup:**
- Current: $7.80
- 52-week range: $5.20-13.50

### OPPORTUNITY #7: QUANTUM COMPUTING FADE (IONQ SHORT)
**Setup Overview:**
The quantum computing bubble is bursting. IONQ rejected hard at $85 and the 300% rally in 3 weeks is unsustainable. As we already have a profitable short position, adding to it on bounces makes sense. Rigetti's 1000% move has peaked.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- IONQ market cap: $12B on <$50M revenue
- Valuation: 250x forward sales
- Competition: IBM, Google (better positioned)

- Target: $38-42
- Stop: $68 (risk management critical)
- Timeline: 2-4 weeks

### OPPORTUNITY #8: REGIONAL BANK MOMENTUM (KRE CALLS)
**Setup Overview:**
Regional banks continue their post-election surge on deregulation hopes and net interest margin expansion. KRE ETF provides diversified exposure to the theme with less single-stock risk. Options provide leveraged upside.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Deregulation tailwinds
- Fed pause = margin stability  
- Loan growth resuming
- Valuation: Still below book value
- M&A acceleration expected

**Technical Setup:**
- KRE at $72
- Breakout above $70 confirmed
- Target: $78-80
- Support: $68

**Trade Structure:**
- Buy KRE Jan $75 calls
- Size: 2% of portfolio in premium
- Target: $80+ by January
- Stop: If KRE breaks below $68

### OPPORTUNITY #9: PTON EARNINGS REVERSAL

## 8. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Portfolio Heat Analysis:**
Current risk exposure across all positions represents approximately 18% of portfolio value at full stop loss levels. This is elevated but acceptable given the binary catalyst opportunities ahead. Individual position stops are critical.

**Correlation Concerns:**
- Tech/growth exposure: Currently 35% (reducing with RGTI trim)
- Biotech binary events: Limiting to 10% combined
- Energy exposure: Balanced with longs and shorts
- Quantum computing: Reducing from overconcentration

**Catalyst Timing Distribution:**
- Week of Nov 11-15: 5 major catalysts (FDA decisions, earnings)
- Week of Nov 18-22: 3 major catalysts (NVDA earnings key)
- Avoiding catalyst overload on any single day
- Binary events spread across different sectors

**Stop Loss Discipline:**
CRITICAL STOPS TO HONOR:
- SAVA: $24 (FDA binary requires tight risk)
- IMVT: $47 (clean setup but respect risk)
- LCID short: $9 (EV sentiment can shift quickly)
- RIVN short: Already stopped out - executing cover
- All biotech plays: 15-20% max loss per position

**Position Sizing Framework:**
- Binary events (FDA): 2-3% max position size
- Earnings catalysts: 3-4% positions
- Short positions: 2-3% to manage squeeze risk
- Options: 1-2% of portfolio in premium per idea
- Core holdings: Can scale to 5% (ARQT example)

**Maximum Loss Scenarios:**
- Per trade: $3,000 hard limit (3% of portfolio)
- Daily: $8,000 maximum (8% circuit breaker)
- Weekly: $15,000 absolute max drawdown
- Binary events: Size for 100% loss potential

**Risk Monitoring Checklist:**
1. Pre-market: Check all catalyst dates/times
2. 9:30 AM: Confirm all stops are placed
3. Hourly: Monitor short positions for squeeze risk
4. 3:00 PM: Assess intraday volatility impacts
5. After-hours: Review binary event results
6. Weekend: Full portfolio reconciliation

**Contingency Planning:**
- If SPY breaks below 675: Reduce long exposure by 25%
- If VIX spikes above 22: Tighten all stops by 20%
- If correlation breaks down: Exit lowest conviction names
- If binary events fail: Do not revenge trade - stick to plan

The next two weeks offer exceptional catalyst trading opportunities. With proper risk management and disciplined execution, we can capitalize on these binary events while protecting capital. The key is position sizing appropriately for the volatility and honoring stops religiously. Let the catalysts come to us.
