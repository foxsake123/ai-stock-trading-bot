## 4. TOP CATALYST OPPORTUNITIES

### 1. **ARQT - Phase 2b Obesity Catalyst****Setup Overview**
ARQT is approaching its pivotal Phase 2b obesity drug readout on November 21. The company has been quietly accumulating positive signals including expanded trial enrollment and management confidence on recent calls. The setup is particularly compelling as the market hasn't fully appreciated the blockbuster potential of their ARQ-252 compound, which showed superior weight loss to existing GLP-1s in early trials.

The opportunity exists due to limited analyst coverage and the stock trading below its October highs despite approaching this binary catalyst. Institutional accumulation has been notable with Citadel and Millennium taking positions last quarter.

**Fundamental Analysis**
- Market Cap: $2.8B (at $26.76)
- Float: 85M shares (23% short interest!)
- Cash Position: $450M (18-month runway)
- No revenue currently (pre-commercial biotech)
- Pipeline: 3 compounds, ARQ-252 most advanced
- Competitive advantage: Oral formulation vs injections

**Technical Setup**
- Current Price: $26.76
- 52-Week Range: $8.50 - $32.10
- Key Support: $24.50 (20-day MA), $22.00 (gap fill)

- Bear Case (15% prob): Failed primary endpoint, stock to $15-18, requiring additional trials

### 2. **PLUG - Hydrogen Infrastructure Catalyst****Setup Overview**
