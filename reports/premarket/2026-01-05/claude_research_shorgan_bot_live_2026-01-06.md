## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

- **SPY Commentary**: Trading near all-time highs (~$610), bullish momentum intact with support at $600. January seasonality favors continuation.
- **QQQ Commentary**: Tech sector showing strength, $540 level holding as support. AI/semiconductor names leading.

- **Upcoming Macro Events**: 
  - Jan 8: ADP Employment Report
  - Jan 10: December Jobs Report
  - Jan 15: CPI Report (critical for Fed policy)
  - Jan 16: Retail Sales
- **Catalyst-Rich Sectors**: Biotech (FDA decisions), Tech (earnings pre-announcements), Energy (oil volatility)
