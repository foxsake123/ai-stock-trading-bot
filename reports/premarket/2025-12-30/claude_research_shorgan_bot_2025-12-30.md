## 12. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Position Limits**:
- **Max Position**: $10,000 (10% of capital)
- **Max Sector**: 25% concentration
- **Current Largest**: CVX short at 12.6% (MONITOR)

**Stop Loss Discipline**:
- **Long Stocks**: 12% max loss from entry
- **Short Stocks**: 7% max loss (tighter due to squeeze risk)
- **Options**: 50% of premium paid

**Portfolio Risk Metrics**:
- **Cash Buffer**: Target $15,000-$25,000 ✓
- **Options Allocation**: <20% of portfolio ✓
- **Daily Loss Limit**: $5,000 (monitor intraday)
- **Correlation Risk**: Tech overweight at 45% (REDUCE)

**Key Risk Factors - This Week**:
1. **Low Volume**: Holiday week = wide spreads, gap risk
2. **Tax Selling**: Complete, but January effect rotation beginning
3. **VIX Low**: Complacency could lead to shock moves
4. **Macro Events**: CPI on Jan 10 is make-or-break for Fed policy
5. **Earnings Vacuum**: Limited catalysts until mid-January

**Risk Mitigation Plan**:
- No new positions on December 31 (half day)
- Reduce gross exposure before CPI (Jan 10)
- Trail stops on all winners >15%
- Cover shorts showing strength (ABNB on watch)
- Maintain 15-20% cash minimum

**Daily Monitoring Checklist**:
- [ ] Pre-market news scan for position impacts
- [ ] Review overnight moves in futures
- [ ] Check option spreads and IV changes  
- [ ] Set alerts for stop levels
- [ ] End-of-day position size verification

**This Week's Priority**: Execute rebalancing plan with discipline. Take profits on extreme winners (ARWR), cut underperformers (SMCI, PLUG partial), and deploy capital into high-conviction catalyst plays for January. The year-end/new-year transition creates unique opportunities for aggressive traders willing to do the work.
