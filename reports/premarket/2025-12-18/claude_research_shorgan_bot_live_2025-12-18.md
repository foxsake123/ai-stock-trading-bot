1. **MUST raise cash** - negative $745 is unsustainable
2. Execute all 6 exit orders first thing
3. Reduce overweight positions to <10%
4. Only enter new positions after exits clear
5. Monitor FOMC minutes at 2 PM for volatility
6. All new positions sized appropriately for $3K account

This rebalancing brings portfolio back to proper risk parameters while maintaining exposure to highest conviction ideas.
