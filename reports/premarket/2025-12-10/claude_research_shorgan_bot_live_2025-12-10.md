# SHORGAN-BOT LIVE WEEKLY DEEP RESEARCH REPORT

## Week 15: December 9-13, 2025

### $3,000 Real Money Catalyst Trading Experiment

---

## 1. MARKET ENVIRONMENT & CATALYST LANDSCAPE (December 2025)**Current Market Regime Assessment (December 9, 2025)**
SPY trading at all-time highs near $684, QQQ at $624, and small-caps (IWM) at $251.88. This represents extreme strength across all market segments, with tech and small-caps both participating in the rally. 

**Key Macro Context This Week:**
- Fed meeting next week (December 17-18) - Market pricing 25bp cut probability
- CPI data Wednesday December 11 - Critical inflation checkpoint
- Retail sales Thursday December 12 - Holiday shopping strength gauge
- Options expiration Friday December 13 - Monthly OPEX could add volatility

**Small-Cap Momentum Analysis ($1B-$10B Companies)**
IWM at $251.88 signals strong risk-on appetite for smaller companies. This creates an ideal environment for catalyst-driven trades in the $500M-$10B market cap range. Key sectors showing momentum:
- Biotech: FDA catalysts driving 20-50% moves
- Software: Q4 earnings pre-announcements starting
- EV/Clean Tech: Policy clarity driving sector rotation
- Gaming/Entertainment: Holiday season strength

**Volatility Environment for Options**
Without VIX data, we'll assess individual stock IV. Current environment suggests:
- Low broad market volatility = cheaper options premiums
- Binary event premiums remain elevated (FDA, earnings)
- Best opportunities in 2-4 week expiries before theta decay
- Focus on high IV rank stocks for selling, low IV for buying

**Affordable Stock Universe ($3-$200) Opportunities**
This week's catalyst calendar includes multiple sub-$50 stocks perfect for our $3K account:
- Biotech catalysts: EDIT, BEAM, RXRX all have upcoming events
- Software earnings: PATH reports December 17
- EV momentum: RIVN, PLUG showing technical strength
- Gaming recovery: BILI approaching key resistance

**Capital Deployment Strategy This Week**
With $319.92 buying power and 12 positions (max), we must:
1. Exit weakest performers to free capital
2. Rotate into imminent catalysts (next 7 days)
3. Consider options for binary events
4. Maintain strict 15% stop losses on all positions

## 6. OPTIONS STRATEGIES FOR $3K ACCOUNTS

**Current Options Environment (December 2025)**
With major indices at all-time highs, implied volatility is compressed except around binary events. This creates opportunities for:
1. Buying cheap options before catalysts
2. Debit spreads to reduce cost
3. Avoiding weekly expirations (theta trap)

**SMALL ACCOUNT OPTIONS RULES REMINDER:**
- Max $300 per options position
- Only liquid underlyings (>$5M daily volume)
- 2-4 week expiries minimum
- Take profits at 50% (don't be greedy)
- Never hold to expiration
- Max 3-4 options positions total

### Recommended Options Trades This Week:

#### 1. PATH Call Debit Spread - December 17 Earnings Play
PATH trading at $19.40 ahead of December 17 earnings.

**Trade Structure:**
- Buy PATH Dec 27 $19 Call @ $1.40
- Sell PATH Dec 27 $22 Call @ $0.50
- Net debit: $0.90 per spread
- Max cost: $90 (1 spread)
- Max profit: $210 (($22-$19-$0.90) × 100)
- Breakeven: $19.90
- Days to expiry: 18 days
- IV percentile: Likely elevated pre-earnings

**Rationale:** Captures earnings move with defined risk. If PATH moves to $22 post-earnings, return 233% on risk.

#### 2. CHWY Straddle Unwind - Post-Earnings Tomorrow
CHWY reports tomorrow morning. IV crush will hit options hard.

**Post-Earnings Strategy:**
- If CHWY gaps up >10%: Buy $32 Put @ ~$0.80
- If CHWY gaps down >10%: Buy $37 Call @ ~$0.80
- Hold for reversion over 1-2 weeks
- Max risk: $80 per contract
- Target: 50% gain on volatility contraction

#### 3. SPY Put Hedge - FOMC Protection
With portfolio near all-time highs, a small hedge makes sense.

**Trade Structure:**
- Buy SPY Dec 20 $675 Put @ $2.20
- 1 contract = $220 cost
- Protects against 1.5% market drop
- Max loss: $220 (acceptable hedge cost)
- Exit before December 18 FOMC if market stable
