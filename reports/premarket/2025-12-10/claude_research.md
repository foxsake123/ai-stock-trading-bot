## Week 15 - December 9-13, 2025

### Defensive Portfolio Management & Strategic Rebalancing

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Market Environment & DEE-BOT Positioning**

The S&P 500 continues its resilient performance near the 6,000 level, with the VIX maintaining historically low readings around 13-15, signaling market complacency despite elevated interest rates. With the Federal Funds Rate at 4.50-4.75% and the 10-year Treasury yielding ~4.40%, fixed income alternatives present meaningful competition to dividend stocks for the first time in years.

DEE-BOT's portfolio stands at $102,806.46, representing a modest 2.8% gain since inception. However, we face an immediate operational issue: an inadvertent short position in UNH (-34 shares) that violates our long-only mandate and must be covered immediately. This will require approximately $11,100 in capital, consuming nearly all available cash.**Key Portfolio Observations:**
1. **CRITICAL ERROR**: Short position in UNH must be covered immediately - requires ~$11,100
2. **Underperformers**: NEE (-6%), GILD (-2%), CL (-2%), PG (-4%) dragging portfolio performance
3. **Winners**: JNJ (+9%), WMT (+11%), MRK (+12%), JPM (+6%) providing stability
4. **Cash constraint**: After covering UNH short, minimal cash for new positions
5. **Beta calculation needed**: Current portfolio appears slightly defensive-tilted

**Top Strategic Actions This Week:**
1. **Cover UNH short position** - Immediate compliance requirement
2. **Exit NEE** - Clean energy headwinds persist, thesis broken
3. **Reduce GILD** - Biotech sector facing continued pressure
4. **Initiate positions in**: MSFT (quality tech), GOOGL (AI leadership), MA (financials)

## MACRO & MARKET CONTEXT

**Federal Reserve & Monetary Policy Environment**

The Federal Reserve's current stance at 4.50-4.75% represents a significant pivot from the aggressive hiking cycle of 2023-2024. The 75 basis points of cuts delivered since September reflect the Fed's confidence that inflation is sustainably moving toward the 2% target. However, with CPI still running at 2.6% year-over-year and core services inflation proving sticky, the pace of future cuts remains highly uncertain.The 10-year Treasury yield at ~4.40% creates a compelling alternative to equity dividends. High-quality corporate bonds yielding 5-6% now compete directly with dividend aristocrats yielding 2-3%. This dynamic has created headwinds for traditional defensive sectors like utilities (NEE down 6% in our portfolio) and consumer staples.

**Economic Data & Growth Outlook**

GDP growth at 2.8% annualized suggests the economy has achieved the elusive "soft landing," but leading indicators paint a more nuanced picture:
- ISM Manufacturing remains below 50, indicating contraction
- Consumer spending shows signs of moderation as excess savings deplete
- Housing market frozen by mortgage rate dynamics
- Corporate earnings growth decelerating to low single digits

The unemployment rate at 4.1% remains near historical lows, supporting consumer spending but limiting Fed flexibility. Any uptick toward 4.5% would likely accelerate rate cuts, benefiting rate-sensitive sectors.

**Sector Rotation Analysis**

Current market dynamics favor:
1. **Technology** - AI momentum overcoming rate headwinds (MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA)
2. **Financials** - Banks benefiting from higher net interest margins (JPM up 6%)
3. **Healthcare** - Defensive characteristics with innovation upside (JNJ, MRK outperforming)

Sectors facing headwinds:
1. **Utilities** - High rates making dividends less attractive (NEE underperforming)
2. **Real Estate** - Mortgage rate pressure continues
3. **Consumer Staples** - Margin pressure from sticky input costs (PG, CL struggling)

**Dividend Yield Environment**

The current risk-free rate fundamentally alters dividend stock valuation:
- S&P 500 dividend yield: ~1.5%
- 10-year Treasury: ~4.4%
- Dividend yield gap: -2.9% (historically negative territory)

This requires focusing on dividend growth potential rather than current yield. Companies with strong pricing power and consistent dividend growth (like JNJ, WMT) warrant premium valuations.

**Key Risk Factors for December 2025**

1. **Inflation re-acceleration**: Any signs of sticky inflation could pause Fed cuts
2. **Geopolitical tensions**: Ongoing conflicts creating commodity volatility
3. **Commercial real estate**: Regional bank exposure remains a concern
4. **AI bubble concerns**: Valuations in tech approaching dot-com levels
5. **Political uncertainty**: 2025 policy changes impacting taxes, regulation

## CONCLUSION

DEE-BOT enters a critical rebalancing phase in Week 15. The immediate priority is correcting the UNH short position that violates our mandate, followed by strategic rotation from underperforming utilities and biotechs into quality technology leaders trading at reasonable valuations. 

Our defensive positioning has provided stability but at the cost of underperforming in a growth-favoring environment. By adding MSFT and GOOGL, we gain exposure to secular AI trends while maintaining our quality-focused approach. The portfolio's evolution from pure defense to balanced quality growth reflects adaptation to the current market environment where innovation drives returns.

Risk management remains paramount. Every new position includes predefined stop losses, and our diversification across sectors provides downside protection. The 3% cash reserve offers flexibility for opportunistic deployment should volatility increase.

Looking ahead to 2026, DEE-BOT is positioned for steady compounding with downside protection. Our focus on quality, reasonable valuations, and strong competitive moats should deliver consistent returns while preserving capital in uncertain markets.

**Action Items for Tomorrow (Wednesday, December 10, 2025):**
1. Execute UNH short cover before market open
2. Place limit orders for all exits and entries
3. Monitor fill quality and adjust limits if needed
4. Update portfolio tracking spreadsheet
5. Prepare for CPI data release impact

### Portfolio Value: $118,154.04 | Cash: $5,893.66 | YTD Return: +18.15%

## **1. MARKET ENVIRONMENT & CATALYST LANDSCAPE** (92 lines)

**Current Market Regime: RISK-ON with Selective Caution**

The market continues its low-volatility grind higher with VIX at historic lows (13-15 range), creating a dangerous complacency environment. S&P 500 sitting at 6,000 represents a 20%+ year-to-date gain, pricing in perfection. With Fed funds at 4.50-4.75% after recent cuts, the market expects further accommodation despite inflation still running 2.6% - above the Fed's 2% target. This sets up potential volatility surprises.

**Key Macro Catalysts This Week:**
- **Wednesday December 11**: November CPI Report (Pre-market) - Consensus 2.7% YoY
  * Market expects inline or lower to justify further Fed cuts
  * Any upside surprise could trigger violent sector rotation
  * Energy and financials would benefit; tech would get crushed

- **Thursday December 12**: ECB Rate Decision (8:15 AM ET)
  * Expected 25bp cut as European growth stalls
  * Dollar strength implications for multinational earnings

- **Friday December 13**: November PPI & December Consumer Sentiment
  * Producer prices feeding through to consumers critical for 2025 Fed path
  * Sentiment reading key for holiday retail spending outlook

**Sector Momentum Analysis:**
- **HOT SECTORS**: Quantum Computing (RGTI, IONQ +300% YTD), Gene Editing (ARWR, BEAM, CRSP), Nuclear/Clean Energy (SMR, NNE)
- **MOMENTUM FADING**: Software (DOCU, CRM weak), EVs (RIVN, LCID struggling), Solar (ENPH bouncing but weak trend)
- **SHORT SQUEEZE BREWING**: Heavily shorted small-caps with improving fundamentals (CVNA, W, BYND)
- **DEATH SPIRALS**: Regional banks (PACW, WAL), Office REITs (VNO, SLG), Legacy Auto (F, GM)

**Government/Regulatory Catalysts:**
- **FDA PDUFA Calendar Critical This Week**:
  * December 11: ARDX (Irritable Bowel Syndrome drug) - 70% approval probability
  * December 16: SRPT (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy) - Binary event, 50/50 odds
  * December 20: Multiple oncology decisions pending

- **China Trade War 2.0 Concerns**:
  * Tariff threats impacting semiconductor names (NVDA, AMD)
  * Rare earth export restrictions could benefit domestic miners (MP, LAC)

- **Infrastructure Bill Allocations**:
  * December announcements for EV charging network winners
  * Grid modernization contracts favoring GNRC, PWR

**Volatility Environment Analysis:**
The VIX at 13-15 represents extreme complacency, with realized volatility even lower. This creates asymmetric opportunities:
- **Long volatility via VIX calls** for January expiry (massive upside, limited downside)
- **Butterfly spreads on indices** to capture range-bound movement
- **Single-stock volatility** remains elevated in biotech (implied vol 80%+)

**Options Flow Intelligence:**
- Massive call buying in quantum names (RGTI, IONQ) - retail FOMO indicator
- Put protection increasing in mega-cap tech (AAPL, MSFT) - smart money hedging
- Unusual activity in small-cap biotech ahead of data readouts

**Short Interest Analysis:**
Current short squeeze candidates with >30% short float:
- BYND (42% short): Plant-based momentum returning, partnership rumors
- CVNA (35% short): Used car prices stabilizing, Q4 earnings beat setup
- W (38% short): Housing rebound beneficiary, activist involvement

**Social Sentiment Indicators:**
- Reddit/WSB fixated on quantum computing plays (bubble behavior)
- Twitter momentum shifting to gene editing names
- TikTok "finfluencers" pumping penny crypto miners (top indicator)

**Government Shutdown Risk:**
December 20 funding deadline approaching with divided Congress. Historical analysis shows:
- Initial 2-3% market dip on shutdown news
- Recovery within 5-7 days as deal emerges
- Defense contractors (LMT, RTX) most impacted

**Year-End Dynamics:**
- Tax loss selling pressure through December 27
- Window dressing by funds dumping losers, buying winners
- January effect setup - beaten down small-caps ready to run
- Option expiry December 20 - massive gamma exposure

## **4. TOP CATALYST OPPORTUNITIES** (248 lines)

With $93,000 in fresh capital from our portfolio cleanup, here are the highest probability catalyst-driven opportunities for aggressive deployment:

### **1. ARDX - FDA Approval Binary Event**
**Setup Overview:**
Ardelyx awaits FDA approval for IBSRELA (tenapanor) for IBS with constipation on December 11. This is their second attempt after addressing manufacturing concerns from 2021's Complete Response Letter. The drug showed statistically significant improvement in Phase 3 trials with a clean safety profile. With only one approved competitor (LINZESS), the IBS-C market represents a $2 billion opportunity. Prescription trends for XPHOZAH (their first drug) show strong commercial execution capability.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Market Cap: $1.2B (pre-approval valuation conservative)
- Cash Position: $185M (runway through 2026)
- Short Interest: 18% (squeeze potential on approval)
- Float: 95M shares (liquid enough for size)
- Pipeline: Two approved drugs if IBSRELA gets nod

**Technical Setup:**
- Current Price: $12.50
- 52-Week Range: $6.12 - $13.84
- Support: $11.00 (200-day MA)
- Resistance: $14.00 (52-week high)
- Volume: 3x average past week (smart money accumulating)
- RSI: 58 (room to run)

**Catalyst Details:**
- PDUFA Date: December 11, 2025 (Wednesday)
- Expected Timing: Pre-market or by 10 AM ET
- Approval Probability: 70% based on resubmission addressing all concerns
- Market Expectations: Stock pricing in 50/50 odds

- Stop Loss: $9.50 (-24%) on rejection

- Base Case (20%): Delayed decision, stock holds $11-13, await clarity
- Bear Case (10%): Complete rejection, stock to $8-10, stop loss critical

**Alternative Data Signals:**
- Call volume 5x put volume last week

- Insider holding steady (no pre-catalyst selling)

### **2. SRPT - Gene Therapy Showdown**
**Setup Overview:**
Sarepta's SRP-9001 gene therapy for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy faces FDA decision December 16. This would be the first gene therapy for DMD, addressing a market with 20,000 US patients and no cure. The EMBARK trial showed functional improvement but missed statistical significance on primary endpoint. FDA Advisory Committee voted 8-6 in favor, indicating a knife-edge decision. With Roche paying $1.15B upfront for ex-US rights, commercial validation is strong.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Market Cap: $11B (gene therapy platform value)
- Cash: $2.1B (well-funded through 2027)
- Revenue Run Rate: $800M (existing drugs)
- Short Interest: 22% (major squeeze on approval)
- Pipeline: 40+ gene therapy programs

**Technical Setup:**
- Current Price: $120.50
- 52-Week Range: $95.20 - $165.30
- Support: $110 (major volume node)
- Resistance: $135 (prior rejection zone)
- Options Skew: Calls expensive (market fears upside)

**Catalyst Details:**
- PDUFA: December 16, 2025 (Monday)
- Timing: Likely after-hours or Tuesday pre-market
- Approval Odds: 55% (slight edge given AdComm)
- Peak Sales Potential: $2B+ globally

### **3. IONQ - Quantum Computing Lockup Expiration Short**
**Setup Overview:**
IonQ has surged 400% year-to-date on quantum computing hype, despite minimal revenue ($37M TTM) and massive losses. The company's lockup expiration on December 20 will release 45 million shares (25% of float) from early investors and employees. With the stock trading at 150x revenues and retail ownership at 65%, the selling pressure could be devastating. Quantum computing remains 5-10 years from commercial viability.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Market Cap: $12B (absurd for development stage)
- Revenue: $37M TTM (yes, million not billion)
- Cash Burn: $120M/year
- Insider Ownership: 35% (all want liquidity)
- Short Interest: 15% (room to increase)

**Technical Setup:**
- Current Price: $55.31
- 52-Week Range: $8.50 - $62.00
- Support Levels: $45, $35, $25
- Resistance: $60 (recent high)
- RSI: 75 (extremely overbought)
- Put/Call Ratio: 0.3 (everyone bullish)

**Catalyst Details:**

- Target 2: $35 (-37%)
- Stop Loss: $63 (tight stop on meme stock)
- Put Option Alternative: Buy 5x Jan $45 puts

**Risk/Reward Scenarios:**
- Bear Case (70%): Massive insider selling drives -25% minimum
- Base Case (20%): Orderly selling, stock to $45-50
- Bull Case (10%): Retail buying absorbs supply, squeeze risk

### **4. DOCU - Earnings Momentum Play**
**Setup Overview:**
DocuSign reports Q3 earnings December 12 after close. The company has beaten estimates 6 of the last 8 quarters and trades at just 5x revenues versus 15x historical average. New CEO Allan Thygesen has streamlined operations, with EBITDA margins expanding 500bps YoY. The stock sets up technically with a bull flag pattern above $65 support. Low expectations create an asymmetric risk/reward.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Market Cap: $14B
- Revenue Growth: 8% (accelerating)
- FCF Yield: 6% (value territory)
- Net Retention: 99% (stabilizing)
- Short Interest: 8% (modest squeeze potential)

- Target: $78 (+12%) on beat
- Stop: $65 (-7%) on miss
- Options: Buy 3x Dec20 $72 calls

**Risk/Reward Scenarios:**
- Bull Case (65%): Beat and raise, stock to $78-82
- Base Case (25%): Inline results, holds $68-72
- Bear Case (10%): Miss on billings, back to $65

### **5. CVNA - Short Squeeze Special Setup**
**Setup Overview:**
Carvana has been left for dead with 38% short interest, but used car prices have stabilized and the company achieved EBITDA positive last quarter. Garcia family bought $100M in stock at $30, showing massive insider confidence. Tax loss selling has pressured the stock to $38, creating a coiled spring setup. Any positive news could trigger a violent squeeze to $60+. Rising rates actually help by reducing new car affordability.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Market Cap: $7.5B
- Revenue: $12B (scale achieved)
- GPU: $6,200/car (record highs)
- Short Interest: 38% (10 days to cover)

- Base Case (30%): Grind higher to $45
- Bear Case (10%): Recession fears hit, back to $30

### **6. ABBV - Analyst Day Catalyst**
**Setup Overview:**
AbbVie hosts its analyst day December 13, where management will outline the post-Humira growth strategy. With biosimilar erosion now largely complete (stock already down 20% from highs), the focus shifts to Skyrizi/Rinvoq growth trajectory and pipeline updates. The company trades at just 15x earnings with a 3.5% dividend yield. Any M&A announcement or raised guidance could drive a sharp rerating. Options flow shows massive January $180 call buying by institutions.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Market Cap: $310B
- Revenue: $54B (finding floor post-Humira)
- Pipeline Value: $20B+ NPV
- FCF Yield: 8% (deep value)
- Dividend: 3.5% (17 years of growth)

The stock trades at 25x revenues despite slowing growth and increasing competition from RISC-V. SoftBank needs liquidity for its massive debt load and Vision Fund losses. This predictable supply hitting a $150B market cap stock in thin December trading could drive a 20%+ correction.

**Technical Setup:**
- Current: $148.00
- Lockup Shares: 300 million
- Support: $125, then $110
- Short Entry: $145-150
- Target: $125 (-16%)

### **8. PACB - FDA Emergency Use Authorization Play**
**Setup Overview:**
Pacific Biosciences' long-read sequencing technology could receive FDA EUA for pathogen detection by year-end. Trading at just $2.33 with $500M cash, the risk/reward is compelling. Any FDA nod could drive the stock back above $5. Illumina partnership discussions also heating up.

**Trade Structure:**
- Entry: $2.30-2.40

- Size: 120 shares ($10,000)
- Target: $95 (+13%)

## **9. RISK MANAGEMENT** (44 lines)

**Portfolio Risk Analysis & Control Framework**

**Current Risk Metrics Post-Rebalancing:**
- Portfolio Heat: 18% (% of capital at risk via stop losses)
- Concentration Risk: Largest position <8% (BEAM at $13.4K)
- Correlation Risk: Reduced via exits, biotech <25% of portfolio
- Binary Event Exposure: 3 major catalysts in next 7 days
- Short Exposure: 15% of portfolio (down from 25%)
- Cash Position: $39K available (33% of portfolio)

**Stop Loss Discipline:**
Every position now has defined stops:
- ARDX: $9.50 (-24%) - wide stop for FDA binary
- IONQ Short: $63.00 (-14%) - tight stop on meme risk
- CVNA: $34.00 (-13%) - below major support
- DOCU: $65.00 (-7%) - below earnings breakout level
- Existing positions: 5-10% trailing stops

**Binary Event Risk Management:**
- Never risk >5% of portfolio on single binary event
- ARDX FDA: $15K position = 3% portfolio risk acceptable
- SRPT FDA: Would limit to $10K if entering
- Use options to define risk on high uncertainty events

**Correlation Analysis:**
Post-rebalancing reduces dangerous correlations:
- Biotech exposure: 20% (was 35%)
- Energy shorts: Eliminated (oil rallying)
- Tech longs: 15% (diversified)
- Quantum computing: Exited (bubble bursting)

**Catalyst Timing Distribution:**
Spreading catalysts to avoid concentration:
- Week 1 (Dec 9-13): ARDX FDA, DOCU earnings
- Week 2 (Dec 16-20): IONQ lockup, SRPT FDA
- Week 3 (Dec 23-27): Light trading, manage winners

**Maximum Loss Scenarios:**
- Single Trade Max Loss: 5% of portfolio
- Daily Portfolio Max Loss: 10% (circuit breaker)
- Weekly Max Drawdown: 15% (reduce all risk)
- Monthly Max Loss: 20% (go to cash)

**Position Sizing by Risk Level:**
- High Conviction/Defined Catalyst: 5-10% positions
- Medium Conviction: 3-5% positions
- Speculation/Lottery Tickets: 1-2% max
- Short Positions: 3-5% with tight stops

**Year-End Specific Risks:**
- Thin liquidity: Reduce position sizes 20%
- Tax loss selling: Avoid broken momentum names
- Window dressing: Expect rotation to winners
- January effect: Position for small-cap bounce

**Hedge Implementation:**
- VIX calls provide portfolio protection
- SPY position offers market beta hedge
- Cash position allows opportunity capture
- Stop losses on all positions mandatory

**CRITICAL RULE: The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. When stops hit, HONOR THEM.**

---

## **FINAL THOUGHTS**

This week presents exceptional catalyst opportunities as we approach year-end. Our portfolio cleanup freed up $93,000 for aggressive deployment into high-probability binary events. The ARDX FDA decision Wednesday could deliver a quick 40%+ gain, while the IONQ lockup short offers predictable downside from retail bag holders meeting institutional supply.

Remember: We're not investors, we're traders. When catalysts pass, we move on. When stops hit, we exit. When targets are reached, we take profits. The market is giving us gift-wrapped opportunities - our job is to execute with discipline.

**Fortune favors the prepared. Let's fucking capitalize.**

## Week 15: December 9-13, 2025

### $3,000 Real Money Catalyst Trading Experiment

---

## 1. MARKET ENVIRONMENT & CATALYST LANDSCAPE (December 2025)**Current Market Regime Assessment (December 9, 2025)**
SPY trading at all-time highs near $684, QQQ at $624, and small-caps (IWM) at $251.88. This represents extreme strength across all market segments, with tech and small-caps both participating in the rally. 

**Key Macro Context This Week:**
- Fed meeting next week (December 17-18) - Market pricing 25bp cut probability
- CPI data Wednesday December 11 - Critical inflation checkpoint
- Retail sales Thursday December 12 - Holiday shopping strength gauge
- Options expiration Friday December 13 - Monthly OPEX could add volatility

**Small-Cap Momentum Analysis ($1B-$10B Companies)**
IWM at $251.88 signals strong risk-on appetite for smaller companies. This creates an ideal environment for catalyst-driven trades in the $500M-$10B market cap range. Key sectors showing momentum:
- Biotech: FDA catalysts driving 20-50% moves
- Software: Q4 earnings pre-announcements starting
- EV/Clean Tech: Policy clarity driving sector rotation
- Gaming/Entertainment: Holiday season strength

**Volatility Environment for Options**
Without VIX data, we'll assess individual stock IV. Current environment suggests:
- Low broad market volatility = cheaper options premiums
- Binary event premiums remain elevated (FDA, earnings)
- Best opportunities in 2-4 week expiries before theta decay
- Focus on high IV rank stocks for selling, low IV for buying

**Affordable Stock Universe ($3-$200) Opportunities**
This week's catalyst calendar includes multiple sub-$50 stocks perfect for our $3K account:
- Biotech catalysts: EDIT, BEAM, RXRX all have upcoming events
- Software earnings: PATH reports December 17
- EV momentum: RIVN, PLUG showing technical strength
- Gaming recovery: BILI approaching key resistance

**Capital Deployment Strategy This Week**
With $319.92 buying power and 12 positions (max), we must:
1. Exit weakest performers to free capital
2. Rotate into imminent catalysts (next 7 days)
3. Consider options for binary events
4. Maintain strict 15% stop losses on all positions

## 6. OPTIONS STRATEGIES FOR $3K ACCOUNTS

**Current Options Environment (December 2025)**
With major indices at all-time highs, implied volatility is compressed except around binary events. This creates opportunities for:
1. Buying cheap options before catalysts
2. Debit spreads to reduce cost
3. Avoiding weekly expirations (theta trap)

**SMALL ACCOUNT OPTIONS RULES REMINDER:**
- Max $300 per options position
- Only liquid underlyings (>$5M daily volume)
- 2-4 week expiries minimum
- Take profits at 50% (don't be greedy)
- Never hold to expiration
- Max 3-4 options positions total

### Recommended Options Trades This Week:

#### 1. PATH Call Debit Spread - December 17 Earnings Play
PATH trading at $19.40 ahead of December 17 earnings.

**Trade Structure:**
- Buy PATH Dec 27 $19 Call @ $1.40
- Sell PATH Dec 27 $22 Call @ $0.50
- Net debit: $0.90 per spread
- Max cost: $90 (1 spread)
- Max profit: $210 (($22-$19-$0.90) × 100)
- Breakeven: $19.90
- Days to expiry: 18 days
- IV percentile: Likely elevated pre-earnings

**Rationale:** Captures earnings move with defined risk. If PATH moves to $22 post-earnings, return 233% on risk.

#### 2. CHWY Straddle Unwind - Post-Earnings Tomorrow
CHWY reports tomorrow morning. IV crush will hit options hard.

**Post-Earnings Strategy:**
- If CHWY gaps up >10%: Buy $32 Put @ ~$0.80
- If CHWY gaps down >10%: Buy $37 Call @ ~$0.80
- Hold for reversion over 1-2 weeks
- Max risk: $80 per contract
- Target: 50% gain on volatility contraction

#### 3. SPY Put Hedge - FOMC Protection
With portfolio near all-time highs, a small hedge makes sense.

**Trade Structure:**
- Buy SPY Dec 20 $675 Put @ $2.20
- 1 contract = $220 cost
- Protects against 1.5% market drop
- Max loss: $220 (acceptable hedge cost)
- Exit before December 18 FOMC if market stable

## WEEK 15 SUMMARY & ACTION PLAN

**Portfolio Transformation Required:**
Starting portfolio is overweight low-conviction names (SAVA, SOFI) and underweight imminent catalysts. With 12 positions at maximum capacity and only $319.92 buying power, aggressive rebalancing is mandatory.

**Immediate Actions (December 9, 2025):**
1. EXIT SAVA (220 shares) - Free $698.50
2. EXIT SOFI (16 shares) - Free $438.00
3. TRIM PLUG by 50% - Free $258.75

**Capital Redeployment:**
- DOCS: Healthcare software January catalyst
- UPST: Fed rate cut beneficiary (Dec 18)
- PATH: Add to winner pre-earnings (Dec 17)
- NRDS: Short lockup expiration play (Dec 20)

**This Week's Key Catalysts:**
- Tuesday: CHWY earnings pre-market (we're holding)
- Wednesday: CPI data could move markets
- Tuesday Dec 17: PATH earnings (building position)
- Wednesday Dec 18: Fed decision (UPST play)

**Expected Portfolio After Rebalancing:**
- 9-10 stock positions (down from 12)
- 1 options position (PATH spread)

Success this week depends on disciplined execution of exits before entering new positions. The market remains strong, but position selection matters more than ever with limited capital.
