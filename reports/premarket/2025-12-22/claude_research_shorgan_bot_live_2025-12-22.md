## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

**SPY Commentary**: Trading at $684.22, showing extreme strength near all-time highs. The S&P 500 continues its relentless march higher despite Fed hawkishness. Key resistance at $685, support at $675.

**QQQ Commentary**: At $618.95, tech mega-caps remain in a strong uptrend. NASDAQ showing resilience with AI and cloud names leading. Watch $620 as key resistance level for breakout.

**IWM Commentary**: Small-caps at $253.57 are underperforming large-caps but still holding above 200-day MA. This is concerning for our small-cap heavy portfolio. Rotation out of small-caps continues.

**Macro Events This Week**:
- Monday 12/23: S&P Global Manufacturing PMI (9:45 AM)
- Monday 12/23: New Home Sales (10:00 AM)
- Tuesday 12/24: Christmas Eve - Early market close 1:00 PM ET
- Wednesday 12/25: Christmas Day - MARKETS CLOSED
- Thursday 12/26: Jobless Claims (8:30 AM)
- Friday 12/27: Low volume day expected

**Catalyst-Rich Sectors**: 
- Biotech: Year-end FDA approvals possible
- Retail: Post-holiday sales data
- Financials: Year-end positioning

**Volatility Regime**: VIX data unavailable but implied low (~13-15 based on SPY stability)

**IV Rank Context**: Holiday week = lower liquidity, wider spreads, avoid options

---

## 7. NEW TRADE SETUPS

**Given negative cash position and holiday week, NO new positions until rebalancing complete!**

### Watchlist for Next Week:

1. **MRNA - Moderna** @ $35.60
   - Oversold biotech, potential bounce candidate
   - Wait for $33-34 entry post-holidays

2. **CLSK - CleanSpark** @ $12.14
   - Bitcoin miner consolidating
   - Watch for breakout above $13

3. **Small-Cap Biotech Scan**
   - FDA calendar picks after New Year
   - Focus on PDUFA dates in January

---

## 8. SHORT OPPORTUNITIES

**Holiday Week = Avoid New Shorts**

Low volume creates squeeze risk. Maintain existing NKE short but don't add new short positions until January when normal volume returns.

---

## 9. OPTIONS TRADES

**NO OPTIONS TRADES THIS WEEK**

Reasons:
1. Holiday week = wide spreads
2. Low liquidity = poor fills
3. Margin pressure = preserve capital
4. No compelling catalysts

## 11. RISK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

**IMMEDIATE PRIORITIES:**

1. **Margin Call Prevention**: Execute all rebalancing trades Monday morning
2. **Holiday Week Rules**: 
   - No new positions until December 27
   - Avoid options completely
   - Exit any day trades by December 24 noon
   - Expect wide spreads and low volume

**Position Management:**
- After rebalancing: 12 positions (down from 17)
- Average position size: ~$250 (8.2% each)
- No position over 10% allocation
- Cash buffer target: $400 minimum by year-end

**Stop-Loss Status Check:**
- All long positions: 15% trailing stops
- NKE short: 18% stop at $67.45
- Options: None active

**Weekly Risk Metrics Post-Rebalancing:**
- Expected Portfolio Value: ~$3,046
- Expected Cash: -$690
- Expected Margin Usage: ~28% (acceptable)
- Max Daily Loss Limit: $300 maintained

**Year-End Considerations:**
1. Tax-loss harvesting: SMCI candidate if needed
2. Avoid wash sale rules on any December sales
3. Prepare for January effect opportunities
4. Build cash for Q1 2026 catalyst plays

**Monday Critical Path:**
1. 9:30 AM: Execute RIVN exit at market
2. 9:35 AM: Place limit orders for all trims
3. 10:00 AM: Verify margin requirement met
4. 10:30 AM: Adjust limits if needed for fills
5. End of day: Confirm cash position improved

---

**FINAL NOTES**: This portfolio requires immediate attention to reduce margin usage from dangerous 58.9% level. The rebalancing plan will free up $1,105 in proceeds, reducing margin pressure significantly. No new positions should be initiated until the cash position stabilizes. Focus this week is entirely on risk reduction given the holiday schedule and current margin situation.
