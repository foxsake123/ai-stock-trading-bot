---

**FINAL THOUGHTS:**

This week represents a critical juncture - we're sitting on +14% unrealized gains with several positions dramatically extended. The disciplined approach is to HARVEST GAINS aggressively while rotating into new catalysts for January. 

The WOLF exit is painful but necessary - maintaining stop discipline is what separates professional traders from amateurs. We'll redeploy that capital plus our trimming proceeds (~$13K) into higher-conviction catalyst plays.

Key themes for the week ahead:
1. **Year-end positioning** - Institutions rebalancing
2. **Tax loss selling** - Creating opportunities in beaten names
3. **January effect prep** - Small-cap biotech leadership
4. **Lockup expirations** - Prime shorting setups

Remember: In thin holiday trading, liquidity matters more than ever. Use limit orders, avoid market orders, and size positions appropriately for the reduced volume environment.

**Next Catalyst Review**: Friday 12/27 at 2 PM ET before PCE data.

Trade with conviction. Manage risk ruthlessly. Let's close 2025 strong.
