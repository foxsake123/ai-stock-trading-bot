## 10. RISK MANAGEMENT

- **Portfolio Beta**: 0.98 (target: 1.0 ± 0.15) ✓
- **Max Single Position**: 7.3% (JPM) - within 10% limit ✓
- **Cash Target**: 1.7% - below 3% target (acceptable given opportunities)
- **Stop Loss Rule**: 8% hard stops on all new positions
- **Rebalancing Trigger**: Beta remains in range, no action needed

**Portfolio Risk Metrics Post-Trades:**
- Number of Positions: 20 (from 21)
- Average Position Size: 5.0%
- Largest Position: JPM at 7.3%
- Sector Concentration: No sector >18%
- Dividend Yield: ~2.6% (improved from 2.4%)

**Key Risk Factors to Monitor:**
1. **Fed Policy**: January FOMC meeting (Jan 28-29, 2026) critical for rate outlook
2. **Earnings Season**: Q4 2025 results begin mid-January - watch guidance
3. **Energy Prices**: Oil below $70 would pressure CVX/XOM positions
4. **Tech Valuations**: AAPL/MSFT P/Es elevated, vulnerable to disappointment
5. **Credit Quality**: Monitor BAC loan losses if economy weakens

**Weekly Review Checklist:**
- [✓] Check portfolio beta: 0.98 - in range
- [✓] Review position weights: INTC reduced from overweight
- [✓] Assess dividend safety: T eliminated, quality improved
- [✓] Monitor upcoming earnings: January earnings calendar reviewed

**Stop Loss Monitoring:**
- HD: $348.02 current, mental stop at $320 (-10% from entry)
- New positions: Hard stops set at -8% from entry
- Winners: Consider trailing stops for BMY, MRK, JNJ above 15% gains

**Next Week's Catalysts (December 22-26, 2025):**
- Shortened holiday week - markets closed December 25
- Light economic calendar
- Year-end tax loss selling may create opportunities
- Monitor for portfolio rebalancing flows

**Portfolio Quality Assessment:**
After rebalancing, portfolio quality improves with:
- Exit of lowest-rated position (T)
- Addition of higher-quality names (ABBV, BAC)
- Maintained exposure to secular winners (MSFT, V, JPM)
- Reduced concentration risk in INTC
- Beta remains appropriately defensive at 0.98

This rebalancing enhances the defensive characteristics of the portfolio while maintaining upside participation through quality growth names. The ~2.6% portfolio yield provides steady income while we wait for opportunities in this late-cycle environment.
