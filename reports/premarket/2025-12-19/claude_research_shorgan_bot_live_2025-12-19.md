**CRITICAL MONDAY MORNING EXECUTION PRIORITIES:**

1. **EXIT all positions marked for sale FIRST** - we need the capital
2. **Verify cash balance becomes positive** before any new buys
3. **Place limit orders for new positions** only after exits clear
4. **Monitor NKE closely** - earnings after close Monday
5. **Set all stop losses immediately** after fills

This rebalancing is ESSENTIAL to restore portfolio health. The negative cash position is unsustainable and must be corrected immediately. After these trades, we'll have a cleaner portfolio of 8-9 positions with proper sizing and positive cash buffer.
