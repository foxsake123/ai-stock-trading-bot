- **S&P 500 Level**: ~6,000 (consolidating after recent gains)
- **VIX**: 13-15 range, indicating low volatility and market complacency
- **10-Year Treasury**: 4.40% - competing with equity dividend yields

- Markets closed Friday on a cautious note ahead of Tuesday's CPI report
- Tech sector showing resilience but valuations remain stretched
- Energy sector seeing renewed interest on Middle East tensions

- Portfolio count at 21 positions exceeds optimal range (10-12)

**Top 3 Conviction Ideas for This Week:**
1. **EXIT Visa (V)**: -9.1% loss, valuation stretched at 29.5x P/E, regulatory headwinds
2. **EXIT Bank of America (BAC)**: -6% loss, banking sector weakness, deposit flight risk
3. **BUY Chevron (CVX)**: Energy exposure, reasonable valuation at 25.7x P/E, dividend yield

**Macro Assessment:**
- **Fed Policy**: Market pricing 2-3 rate cuts in 2026, next FOMC March 18-19
- **Economic Data**: CPI on Tuesday (Feb 17) critical for rate expectations
- **Yield Environment**: 10Y at 4.40% makes dividend stocks less attractive
- **Risk Factors**: Banking stress, geopolitical tensions, valuation concerns

## 10. RISK MANAGEMENT

- **Portfolio Beta**: ~1.08 (within target range 0.85-1.15) ✓
- **Position Count**: Will be 17 after trades (still above 12 target)
- **Cash Target**: Will be ~7.4% after trades (above 3-5% target) ✓
- **Stop Loss Rule**: 8% hard stops on all new positions ✓
- **Single Position Max**: All positions under 10% limit ✓

**Daily Review Checklist:**
- [X] Portfolio beta within range (1.08)
- [X] Review position weights (MA at 7% - monitor)
- [X] Assess dividend safety (all dividends secure)
- [ ] Monitor Tuesday CPI print impact
- [ ] Watch banking sector stress (BAC exit timely)
- [ ] Energy position entries (CVX, XOM limit orders)

**Key Risks to Monitor:**
1. **Banking Contagion**: Regional bank stress could spread
2. **CPI Tuesday**: Higher than expected could pressure markets
3. **Tech Valuations**: MSFT, AAPL vulnerable to multiple compression
4. **Energy Volatility**: New CVX/XOM positions subject to oil swings
5. **Concentration**: Still need to reduce position count over time

**Action Items This Week:**
1. Execute exit trades Monday morning (BAC, V, PFE)
2. Place trim orders for profit-taking (JNJ, NEE, WMT)
3. Enter energy positions with strict limit orders
4. Monitor Tuesday CPI for market impact
5. Review remaining 17 positions for further consolidation

**Portfolio Improvement Plan:**
- Continue reducing position count toward 10-12 target
- Maintain defensive bias in uncertain macro environment
- Focus on quality dividend payers with reasonable valuations
- Keep cash buffer elevated given market risks
- Use any market weakness to upgrade portfolio quality

---

**Report Summary**: DEE-BOT portfolio showing solid 4.6% unrealized gains but requires rebalancing. Exiting weak financial positions (BAC, V) and small holdings (PFE) while booking partial profits on extended winners (JNJ, NEE, WMT). Adding energy exposure through CVX and XOM for sector diversification. Post-trade cash position will be healthy at 7.4%, providing flexibility for future opportunities. Focus remains on capital preservation with quality dividend-paying equities.
