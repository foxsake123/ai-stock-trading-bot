## 10. RISK MANAGEMENT

- **Portfolio Beta**: 0.98 (target: 1.0 ± 0.15) ✓
- **Max Single Position**: 7.3% (JPM) - within 10% limit ✓
- **Cash Target**: 1.7% - below 3% target (acceptable given opportunities)
- **Stop Loss Rule**: 8% hard stops on all new positions
- **Rebalancing Trigger**: Beta remains in range, no action needed

**Portfolio Risk Metrics Post-Trades:**
- Number of Positions: 20 (from 21)
- Average Position Size: 5.0%
- Largest Position: JPM at 7.3%
- Sector Concentration: No sector >18%
- Dividend Yield: ~2.6% (improved from 2.4%)

**Key Risk Factors to Monitor:**
1. **Fed Policy**: January FOMC meeting (Jan 28-29, 2026) critical for rate outlook
2. **Earnings Season**: Q4 2025 results begin mid-January - watch guidance
3. **Energy Prices**: Oil below $70 would pressure CVX/XOM positions
4. **Tech Valuations**: AAPL/MSFT P/Es elevated, vulnerable to disappointment
5. **Credit Quality**: Monitor BAC loan losses if economy weakens

**Weekly Review Checklist:**
- [✓] Check portfolio beta: 0.98 - in range
- [✓] Review position weights: INTC reduced from overweight
- [✓] Assess dividend safety: T eliminated, quality improved
- [✓] Monitor upcoming earnings: January earnings calendar reviewed

**Stop Loss Monitoring:**
- HD: $348.02 current, mental stop at $320 (-10% from entry)
- New positions: Hard stops set at -8% from entry
- Winners: Consider trailing stops for BMY, MRK, JNJ above 15% gains

**Next Week's Catalysts (December 22-26, 2025):**
- Shortened holiday week - markets closed December 25
- Light economic calendar
- Year-end tax loss selling may create opportunities
- Monitor for portfolio rebalancing flows

**Portfolio Quality Assessment:**
After rebalancing, portfolio quality improves with:
- Exit of lowest-rated position (T)
- Addition of higher-quality names (ABBV, BAC)
- Maintained exposure to secular winners (MSFT, V, JPM)
- Reduced concentration risk in INTC
- Beta remains appropriately defensive at 0.98

This rebalancing enhances the defensive characteristics of the portfolio while maintaining upside participation through quality growth names. The ~2.6% portfolio yield provides steady income while we wait for opportunities in this late-cycle environment.

- Friday 12/27: Pending home sales, year-end window dressing begins
- Monday 12/30: Chicago PMI, positioning for 2026
- Tuesday 12/31: Half day, final 2025 trades

**Institutional Flow Signals**:
- Tax loss selling ACCELERATING in beaten-down tech
- Window dressing into strength (mega-cap tech)

## 12. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Portfolio Risk Parameters:**
- **Max Position Size**: $10,000 (8.9% of portfolio)
- **Max Sector Concentration**: 25% (Currently: Biotech 18%, Tech 22%)
- **Stop Loss Discipline**: 12% for longs, 15% for shorts (STRICTLY ENFORCED)
- **Options Allocation**: Max 20% ($22,580 limit) - Currently 12%
- **Cash Buffer Target**: $20,000 minimum through year-end
- **Daily Loss Limit**: $5,000 (4.4% of portfolio)

**Year-End Risk Considerations:**
1. **Liquidity Risk**: Many names will see reduced volume 12/23-12/31
2. **Gap Risk**: Wider spreads, potential for overnight gaps
3. **Tax Selling**: Beaten names may see accelerated selling through 12/31
4. **Window Dressing**: Institutions rotating into winners for year-end reporting
5. **January Effect**: Small-caps typically outperform in early January

**Catalyst Risk Matrix:**
- **SAGE FDA**: Binary 40%+ move expected - position sized accordingly
- **Lockup Shorts**: Tight stops required due to squeeze risk
- **Earnings Plays**: IV crush post-earnings - use spreads not naked options
- **Biotech Concentration**: Monitor sector allocation, currently 18%

**Stop Loss Schedule:**
- All new positions: Orders placed immediately at entry
- Trailing stops: Activated at +15% gain
- Mental stops: Converted to hard stops before weekends/holidays

**Year-End Trading Schedule:**
- Dec 24: Half day (close 1 PM ET)
- Dec 25: CLOSED
- Dec 31: Half day (close 1 PM ET)  
- Jan 1: CLOSED

**Key Monitoring Metrics:**
- VIX: Alert if >16 (volatility regime change)
- Dollar Index: Alert if breaks 102 (impacts multinationals)
- 10-Year Yield: Alert if >4.6% (growth stock pressure)
- Oil: Alert if <$85 or >$95 (energy short impacts)

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
1. Monday's SAGE FDA decision is BINARY - size accordingly
2. Low volume next week = wider spreads, use limit orders
3. Tax loss selling accelerates Monday - opportunity in oversold names
4. Lockup expiration shorts need TIGHT risk management
5. January typically sees small-cap outperformance - position early

**Weekend Homework:**
- Review all stop losses before Monday open
- Set alerts for FDA announcement (SAGE)
- Identify tax loss reversal candidates for 12/31
- Update catalyst calendar for January
- Calculate year-end tax implications

This aggressive catalyst-hunting approach targets 20-30% portfolio returns through precise timing of binary events and momentum trades. The mix of longs, shorts, and options provides multiple profit vectors while managing risk through position sizing and stops. Focus on EXECUTION - the trades are identified, now it's about precise entries and disciplined exits.

**CRITICAL MONDAY MORNING EXECUTION PRIORITIES:**

1. **EXIT all positions marked for sale FIRST** - we need the capital
2. **Verify cash balance becomes positive** before any new buys
3. **Place limit orders for new positions** only after exits clear
4. **Monitor NKE closely** - earnings after close Monday
5. **Set all stop losses immediately** after fills

This rebalancing is ESSENTIAL to restore portfolio health. The negative cash position is unsustainable and must be corrected immediately. After these trades, we'll have a cleaner portfolio of 8-9 positions with proper sizing and positive cash buffer.
