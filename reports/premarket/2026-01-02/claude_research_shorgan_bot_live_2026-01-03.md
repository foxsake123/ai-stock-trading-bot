## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW**Market Analysis (Based on Current Levels):**

- **SPY Commentary**: Currently at $680.37, showing strength to start 2026. Tight bid/ask spread (0.01%) indicates healthy liquidity. Market appears to be in a continuation pattern after year-end positioning.

- **QQQ Commentary**: Tech-heavy index at $610.80, maintaining relative strength. Mega-cap tech continues to lead, creating headwinds for small-cap growth stocks in our portfolio.

- **IWM Commentary**: Small-caps at $246.90, underperforming large-caps significantly. This weakness is impacting our small/mid-cap catalyst plays (DNLI, PRTA, UPST).

- **Upcoming Macro Events**:
  - January 8: December CPI data (critical for Fed policy)
  - January 9: Initial jobless claims
  - January 14: PPI & retail sales data
  - January 15: Fed Beige Book
  - January 28-29: FOMC Meeting (first of 2026)

- **Catalyst-Rich Sectors**:
  - **Biotech**: Q4 earnings season starts mid-January
  - **Fintech**: Bank earnings begin January 15
  - **EV/Clean Energy**: Policy clarity expected post-inauguration

- **Volatility Regime**: VIX remains subdued (13-15 range), creating favorable entry conditions but limiting options premiums

- **IV Rank Context**: Overall market IV in 25th percentile - low volatility environment favors stock positions over options
