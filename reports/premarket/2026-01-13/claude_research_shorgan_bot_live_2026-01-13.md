## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

- **SPY Commentary**: Trading at $695.40, significantly above the ~$600 reference from December 2025. Strong uptrend continues with tight bid/ask spread ($0.07), indicating healthy liquidity. Support sits near $680, resistance at $700.

- **QQQ Commentary**: At $626.97, tech sector shows continued strength. Tight spreads ($0.05) suggest institutional confidence. The tech momentum remains intact despite recent volatility concerns.

- **IWM Commentary**: Small-caps at $260.96 showing relative underperformance vs large caps. This creates opportunities in beaten-down names but also signals risk-off sentiment toward growth stories.

- **Upcoming Macro Events** (Week of Jan 13-17):
  - Tuesday 1/14: December PPI (8:30 AM ET)
  - Wednesday 1/15: Fed Beige Book (2:00 PM ET)
  - Thursday 1/16: Initial Jobless Claims, Philly Fed Index
  - Friday 1/17: Housing Starts, Consumer Sentiment

- **Catalyst-Rich Sectors**: 
  - Biotech: FDA decision season continues
  - Tech: Q4 earnings preview starting next week
  - EV/Battery: Policy updates expected
  - Fintech: Bank earnings starting 1/15

- **Volatility Regime**: VIX data unavailable but market spreads suggest low volatility environment. Options premiums likely compressed.

- **IV Rank Context**: Based on tight bid/ask spreads in major indices, overall market implied volatility appears below average, favoring options buyers over sellers.
