## 12. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Position Limits:**
- **Max Position**: $10,000 (10% of capital) ✓
- **Max Sector**: 25% concentration - Tech at 23% (monitor)
- **Stop Loss Rules**: 12% stocks, 15% shorts (ENFORCED)
- **Options Limit**: 15% of portfolio (current: 8%)
- **Cash Target**: $15,000-$25,000 (projected: $18,500 after trades)
- **Daily Loss Limit**: $5,000 (circuit breaker active)

**Risk Monitoring Dashboard:**
- Largest Position: GKOS at 11.3% (after trim)
- Sector Concentration: Tech 23%, Healthcare 18%, Energy 15%
- Short Exposure: 15.8% of portfolio (4 positions)
- Options Exposure: $4,390 premium at risk
- Beta-Weighted Portfolio: 1.15 vs SPY

**Catalyst Risk Calendar:**
- 12/18: FOMC - Hedged with SPY puts
- 12/19: ORCL earnings - EXITING position
- 12/23: ABNB lockup - SHORT initiated
- 12/31: Year-end rebalancing flows

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. EXIT any position down >25% immediately (WOLF executed)
2. TRIM winners >50% by half (ARWR executed)
3. NO averaging down on losers
4. HONOR all stop losses - no exceptions
5. Review all positions if SPY breaks $675 support

This aggressive catalyst-driven approach targets 20%+ returns while managing downside through disciplined exits and hedging. The shift from broken tech names (WOLF, ORCL) into momentum plays (IONQ, SMCI) and oversold bounces (MRNA) positions us for a strong finish to 2025.

## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

- **SPY Commentary**: At $680.89, SPY continues testing all-time highs. Support at $675, resistance at $685. Bullish trend intact but extended.

- **QQQ Commentary**: Tech-heavy Nasdaq at $612.06, showing resilience. Key support at $605, resistance at $615. Mega-cap tech leading despite rate concerns.

- **IWM Commentary**: Small-caps at $252.25, still lagging large-caps significantly. This is our primary hunting ground - elevated risk but higher reward potential. Critical support at $250.

- **Macro Events This Week**: 
  - Tuesday (12/16): Retail Sales data (8:30am ET)
  - Wednesday (12/17): Fed's Goolsbee speaks (1:00pm ET)
  - Thursday (12/18): Initial Jobless Claims, Philly Fed Manufacturing
  - Friday (12/19): Options expiration, Triple witching

- **Catalyst-Rich Sectors**: 
  - Biotech: Multiple FDA decision dates pending
  - EV/Clean Energy: Policy uncertainty creates volatility
  - Software: Earnings season winding down, guidance key

- **Volatility Regime**: VIX data unavailable but based on SPY price action, likely in 13-15 range indicating low volatility. This suppresses options premiums but increases risk of surprise moves.

- **IV Rank Context**: Overall market IV appears compressed based on tight bid-ask spreads, making long options less attractive but creating potential for volatility expansion plays.

- Options: 50% of premium (or exit if catalyst fails)
- Shorts: 18% stop (shorts can squeeze)

- Max position: $300 (limits single-name risk)
- Max single stock: 12% of portfolio
- Max sector concentration: 30%

**Cash Buffer Target**: $400-$600

- Current: $30 proposed (1% - well within limit)
- Never hold options to expiry
- Exit 2 days before expiration minimum

**Weekly Review Triggers:**
- If portfolio -5% in week → review all positions ✓ (Currently -8.8%)
- If any position -20% → mandatory reassessment
- If 3+ positions show "BROKEN" thesis → reduce exposure ✓ (PATH, SAVA exiting)

**CRITICAL PRIORITIES FOR WEEK 16:**
1. **RESTORE POSITIVE CASH BALANCE** - Execute all exits/trims immediately
2. **REDUCE MARGIN USAGE** - Target under 20% by week end  
3. **IMPROVE POSITION SIZING** - No position over 12%
