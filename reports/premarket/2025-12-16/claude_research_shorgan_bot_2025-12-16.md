## 12. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Position Limits:**
- **Max Position**: $10,000 (10% of capital) ✓
- **Max Sector**: 25% concentration - Tech at 23% (monitor)
- **Stop Loss Rules**: 12% stocks, 15% shorts (ENFORCED)
- **Options Limit**: 15% of portfolio (current: 8%)
- **Cash Target**: $15,000-$25,000 (projected: $18,500 after trades)
- **Daily Loss Limit**: $5,000 (circuit breaker active)

**Risk Monitoring Dashboard:**
- Largest Position: GKOS at 11.3% (after trim)
- Sector Concentration: Tech 23%, Healthcare 18%, Energy 15%
- Short Exposure: 15.8% of portfolio (4 positions)
- Options Exposure: $4,390 premium at risk
- Beta-Weighted Portfolio: 1.15 vs SPY

**Catalyst Risk Calendar:**
- 12/18: FOMC - Hedged with SPY puts
- 12/19: ORCL earnings - EXITING position
- 12/23: ABNB lockup - SHORT initiated
- 12/31: Year-end rebalancing flows

**CRITICAL RULES:**
1. EXIT any position down >25% immediately (WOLF executed)
2. TRIM winners >50% by half (ARWR executed)
3. NO averaging down on losers
4. HONOR all stop losses - no exceptions
5. Review all positions if SPY breaks $675 support

This aggressive catalyst-driven approach targets 20%+ returns while managing downside through disciplined exits and hedging. The shift from broken tech names (WOLF, ORCL) into momentum plays (IONQ, SMCI) and oversold bounces (MRNA) positions us for a strong finish to 2025.
