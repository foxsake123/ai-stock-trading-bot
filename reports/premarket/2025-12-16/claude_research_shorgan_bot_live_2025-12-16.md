## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

- **SPY Commentary**: At $680.89, SPY continues testing all-time highs. Support at $675, resistance at $685. Bullish trend intact but extended.

- **QQQ Commentary**: Tech-heavy Nasdaq at $612.06, showing resilience. Key support at $605, resistance at $615. Mega-cap tech leading despite rate concerns.

- **IWM Commentary**: Small-caps at $252.25, still lagging large-caps significantly. This is our primary hunting ground - elevated risk but higher reward potential. Critical support at $250.

- **Macro Events This Week**: 
  - Tuesday (12/16): Retail Sales data (8:30am ET)
  - Wednesday (12/17): Fed's Goolsbee speaks (1:00pm ET)
  - Thursday (12/18): Initial Jobless Claims, Philly Fed Manufacturing
  - Friday (12/19): Options expiration, Triple witching

- **Catalyst-Rich Sectors**: 
  - Biotech: Multiple FDA decision dates pending
  - EV/Clean Energy: Policy uncertainty creates volatility
  - Software: Earnings season winding down, guidance key

- **Volatility Regime**: VIX data unavailable but based on SPY price action, likely in 13-15 range indicating low volatility. This suppresses options premiums but increases risk of surprise moves.

- **IV Rank Context**: Overall market IV appears compressed based on tight bid-ask spreads, making long options less attractive but creating potential for volatility expansion plays.
