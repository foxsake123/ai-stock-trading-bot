## 10. RISK MANAGEMENT

- **Portfolio Beta**: ~1.02 (on target)
- **Post-Trade Beta**: ~1.01 (improved balance)
- **Max Single Position**: MA reduced from 8.2% to 6.1%
- **Cash Target**: 5.4% post-trades (appropriate buffer)
- **Stop Loss Coverage**: All new positions with 8% stops

**Position Sizing Check:**
- Largest: AAPL 7.4%
- Smallest: UNH 2.5% (new)
- Average: 5.5%

**Risk Monitoring Priorities:**
1. **CPI Release (Wed 2/11)**: Monitor inflation impact
2. **V Weakness**: Technical breakdown needs watching
3. **BAC/Regional Banks**: Rate sensitivity high
4. **Energy Absence**: Consider XOM if oil spikes

**Daily Review Checklist:**
- [X] Portfolio beta within range (1.0 ± 0.15)
- [X] No positions exceed 8% weight (post MA trim)
- [ ] Review Wednesday CPI impact
- [ ] Monitor V for potential support at $320
- [ ] Track new position fills and stops

**Contingency Plans:**
- If CPI hot: Reduce rate-sensitive financials
- If market breaks 6,850 (SPY $685): Raise cash to 8%
- If V breaks $320: Consider averaging down

**Key Metrics Summary:**
- Sharpe Ratio Target: >1.0
- Max Drawdown Limit: -15%
- Turnover Target: <50% annually
- Dividend Growth: Focus on 5%+ growers

---

**Report Conclusion:**

DEE-BOT portfolio remains well-positioned with strong YTD performance of +11.9%. Today's rebalancing addresses the MA overweight issue while deploying excess cash into three high-quality opportunities. The portfolio maintains its defensive character while adding exposure to secular growth themes in technology and healthcare. Risk management remains paramount with all positions protected by stops and appropriate position sizing.

**Tomorrow's Focus**: Execute rebalancing trades and monitor CPI release impact.
