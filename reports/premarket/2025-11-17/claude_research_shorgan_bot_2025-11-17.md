## 8. RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK

### PORTFOLIO RISK PARAMETERS

**Current Risk Metrics:**
- Portfolio Value: $105,243
- At-Risk Capital (stops): ~$12,000 (11.4% of portfolio)
- Beta-Weighted Delta: -$15,000 (slightly short biased)
- Catalyst Concentration: 5 events on November 19 (too many!)

**Maximum Risk Limits:**
- Single position: 8% of portfolio max ($8,420)
- Single day catalyst exposure: 20% max  
- Binary event exposure: 15% max
- Sector concentration: 30% max (biotech at 35% - MUST REDUCE)

**Stop Loss Discipline:**
- Catalyst trades: 8-10% hard stops
- Momentum trades: Trail at 15% profit
- Short positions: 5% stops MANDATORY
- Options: Risk defined by premium paid

**Position Sizing by Conviction:**
- Highest conviction: 5-8% positions
- Standard catalyst: 3-5% positions  
- Speculative/binary: 1-2% positions
- Options: 0.5-1% per trade max

**Catalyst Timing Management:**
- Space out binary events (not all same day)
- Take partial profits into catalysts
- Reduce position size if multiple catalysts same week
- Always have dry powder for opportunities

**Weekly Risk Review Process:**
1. Calculate total portfolio heat
2. Review correlation between positions  
3. Stress test -20% market scenario
4. Ensure 25%+ cash for opportunities
5. Exit losers that break stop levels

**Key Risk This Week:**
Too much exposure to November 19 catalysts (NVDA, SRRK, PANW). Must size appropriately and consider hedges. Biotech concentration at 35% needs reduction through profit-taking or exits.

The market is giving us incredible catalyst opportunities but discipline on position sizing and risk management will determine success. Better to miss some upside than blow up on concentrated binary events.

Remember: We're not trying to hit home runs every at-bat. Singles and doubles with occasional homers build wealth. The losses we avoid are more important than the gains we miss.

EXECUTE THE PLAN. RESPECT THE STOPS. TRUST THE PROCESS.
