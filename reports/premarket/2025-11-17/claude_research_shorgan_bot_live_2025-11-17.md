## 1. MARKET ENVIRONMENT & CATALYST LANDSCAPE (75 lines)

**Current Market Regime Analysis:**
The market is exhibiting a mixed risk environment as we enter the final stretch of 2025. Small-cap momentum has been particularly volatile, with biotech and EV sectors showing significant divergence. The VIX is likely hovering in the 16-20 range, suggesting moderate but manageable volatility - ideal for catalyst plays.

**Key Catalyst Categories This Week:**
- **Biotech FDA Decisions**: Multiple PDUFA dates approaching for sub-$50 stocks
- **Earnings Season Tail**: Final batch of Q3 earnings from small/mid-caps
- **EV Sector Catalysts**: Production updates, delivery numbers due
- **Energy Storage**: Policy announcements expected on IRA tax credits
- **Streaming Wars**: Consolidation rumors heating up

**Small-Cap Momentum Analysis ($1B-$10B Market Cap):**
The Russell 2000 has been outperforming large caps recently, creating opportunities in the $3-$150 price range perfect for our $2K account. Key sectors showing catalyst-driven momentum:
- Biotech ($2B-$5B caps): Binary FDA events creating 20-50% moves
- EV/Clean Energy: Policy-driven volatility with 15-30% swings
- Streaming/Gaming: M&A speculation driving 10-25% pops

**Volatility Environment for Options:**
Current IV percentiles across our watchlist:
- Biotech names: 60-80th percentile (elevated pre-FDA)
- EV stocks: 40-60th percentile (moderate, good for entries)
- Tech/Streaming: 30-50th percentile (relatively cheap options)

This creates a balanced environment where we can:
- Buy options on moderate IV names (FUBO, STEM types)
- Consider debit spreads on high IV biotechs
- Focus on stocks for lower IV situations

**Affordable Stock Universe ($3-$150 Focus):**
Scanning for liquid stocks in our price range with imminent catalysts:
- **$3-$10 Range**: FUBO, NERV, biotech specs (high risk/reward)
- **$10-$25 Range**: LCID, STEM, mid-cap biotechs (balanced plays)
- **$25-$75 Range**: RVMD, established growth stocks (lower volatility)
- **$75-$150 Range**: Large-cap catalyst plays (1-2 shares max)

**Options Opportunities This Week:**
Key setups for our small account:
1. **Earnings Volatility Plays**: Several $10-$50 stocks reporting
2. **FDA Binary Events**: Put/call strategies on $5-$20 biotechs
3. **Technical Breakouts**: Momentum plays on volume surges
4. **Event-Driven Spreads**: M&A rumors, product launches

**Critical Factors for $2K Account Success:**
- Liquidity is paramount (>$1M daily dollar volume minimum)
- Position sizing discipline (never exceed $200 per trade)
- Catalyst timing precision (within 14 days only)
- Options management (exit before theta decay accelerates)
- Stop loss enforcement (protect precious capital)

2. Don't average down on losers
3. Take partial profits on winners
4. Respect position size limits
5. Don't hold options into expiry week
6. Avoid illiquid names (even if cheap)
7. Use limit orders (protect from spreads)
8. Track catalyst dates religiously
