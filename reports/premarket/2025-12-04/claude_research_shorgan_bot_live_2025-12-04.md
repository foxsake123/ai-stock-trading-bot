## 5. OPTIONS STRATEGIES FOR $3K ACCOUNTS

### Options Market Overview (December 3, 2025)
With VIX below 15, we're in a low volatility regime that makes buying options cheaper, but selling premium less attractive. Focus on directional plays around binary catalysts where implied volatility hasn't yet spiked. Small accounts must be selective - only the highest conviction setups.

```

### SMALL ACCOUNT OPTIONS RULES
1. **Position Sizing**: Never more than $300 per options trade (10% of account)
2. **Expiry Selection**: Minimum 2 weeks out, prefer 3-4 weeks
3. **Profit Taking**: Sell 50% at 50% gain, let rest run with stop
4. **Loss Management**: Exit at 50% loss unless catalyst still pending
5. **IV Awareness**: Check IV percentile - avoid >80th unless binary event
6. **Spread Usage**: Use debit spreads for expensive stocks (>$50)
7. **Assignment Risk**: Close spreads before expiry to avoid
8. **Liquidity First**: Only trade options with <$0.10 bid-ask spread

### Options to AVOID This Week
- Weekly options expiring Dec 6 (too little time)
- Any options over $3.00 premium (too expensive)
- Naked short options (undefined risk)
- Options on stocks <$1M daily volume
- Iron condors/complex strategies (not for $3K accounts)

### Catalyst Risk Management
**Pre-Catalyst Checklist:**

2. Check options liquidity if playing derivatives
3. Size position for binary outcome (can lose 100%)
4. Set alerts for pre-market/after-hours movement
5. Have exit plan for both scenarios

**Post-Catalyst Actions:**
- Win: Take 50% off immediately, trail stop rest
- Loss: Exit completely, no averaging down
- No action: Exit if down >10% anyway

### Options-Specific Risk Rules
1. **Time Decay**: Exit all options 2 days before expiry minimum
2. **IV Crush**: Sell into IV expansion pre-event
3. **Spread Management**: Close spreads early to avoid assignment
4. **Weekend Risk**: Reduce options exposure on Fridays
5. **Earnings**: Exit day before to avoid IV crush

### Psychology and Discipline
**Rules for $3K Account Success:**
- No revenge trading after losses
- No FOMO entries after 10%+ moves
- No averaging down on losers
- No position size increases when winning
- Take breaks after 3 consecutive losses
- Journal every trade with honest assessment

### Weekly Risk Review Checklist
Every Friday at 3:30 PM:
- [ ] Calculate week's P&L and win rate
- [ ] Review largest winners and losers
- [ ] Check position concentration (nothing >15%)
- [ ] Verify cash balance is positive
- [ ] Close any options expiring within 7 days
- [ ] Reduce positions if over 12 total
- [ ] Set alerts for next week's catalysts
