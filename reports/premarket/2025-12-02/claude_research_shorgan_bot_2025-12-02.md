## SHORGAN-BOT WEEKLY CATALYST PLAYBOOK
**Week 14 | December 2, 2025 | Portfolio Value: $114,441.13**

### 1. MARKET ENVIRONMENT & CATALYST LANDSCAPE

The market enters December with a powerful risk-on regime as we approach year-end positioning battles. SPY sits near all-time highs at $682, up 5% in just 30 days. This Santa Claus rally setup is creating extreme bifurcation - momentum names are going parabolic while value shorts are getting obliterated.

**Current Market Regime: AGGRESSIVE RISK-ON**
- VIX collapsed to 14 handle, implying low volatility through year-end
- Tech/growth outperforming value by widest margin since 2021
- Short squeeze dynamics intensifying as funds cover into strength
- Biotech sector heating up with M&A speculation and FDA approvals
- Energy shorts working as oil weakens on demand concerns

**December Catalyst Tsunami Approaching:**
- FDA PDUFA calendar loaded: 6 binary decisions before Dec 20
- Earnings season final wave: retail/software reporting this week
- Fed meeting December 17-18: 25bp cut expected (85% probability)
- Tax-loss selling creating artificial pressure on losers
- Window dressing flows accelerating into quarter-end**Sector Momentum Analysis:**
- Tech (XLK $290.35): Unstoppable momentum, AI narrative intact
- Biotech (XBI $119.79): Breaking out on FDA approval optimism  
- Small caps (IWM $246.36): Lagging but coiled for catch-up rally
- Energy (XLE $90.07): Breakdown confirmed, short thesis playing out
- Cannabis (MSOS $3.81): Tax-loss selling creating deep value
- Innovation (ARKK $78.72): Recovering but still 50% off highs

**Short Squeeze Alert List:**
High short interest names with positive catalysts are exploding higher. Our IONQ short is a painful example - down from $74 to $48 in our favor. Key squeeze candidates this week:
- CVNA: 30% short interest, earnings Tuesday 
- BYND: 40% short interest, partnership rumors
- SPCE: 25% short interest, test flight catalyst
- W: 28% short interest, housing data positive

**Government/Regulatory Catalysts This Week:**
- FDA Decision on SNDL cancer drug (Dec 5)
- Senate hearing on AI regulation (Dec 6) 
- China trade data release (Dec 8)
- November CPI report (Dec 11)
- Fed speakers throughout the week

**Options Flow Signals:**
Unusual activity detected in multiple names suggesting institutional positioning ahead of catalysts. Call buying aggressive in biotech, while put protection being bought in overextended tech names. The put/call ratio at 0.65 suggests complacency - perfect for aggressive catalyst trading.

### 9. RISK MANAGEMENT 

Current portfolio heat map shows concentrated risk that needs active management:

**Position Sizing Discipline:**
- Tier 1 (Binary FDA): 3-4% max position (AVDX)
- Tier 2 (Earnings/Data): 4-5% max position (STXS)  
- Tier 3 (Technical/Momentum): 2-3% positions
- Short positions: 2% initial, 4% max

**Stop Loss Requirements:**
- Binary events: 15-20% stop (wider due to volatility)
- Momentum trades: 8-10% stop (tighter risk control)
- Short positions: 10% max loss before covering
- Portfolio heat: Never exceed 15% at risk

**Correlation Management:**
- Current biotech concentration at 35% (reduce to 25%)
- Tech exposure at 20% (comfortable level)
- Need commodity/industrial exposure for balance
- Short book at 15% of capital (can increase to 20%)

**Catalyst Timing Optimization:**
- December 2-6: Maximum 5 binary events
- Stagger entries to avoid correlation shocks
- Keep 30% cash for opportunistic trades
- Year-end liquidity concerns = smaller positions

**Maximum Loss Scenarios:**
- Per trade: $2,000 hard limit (1.75% of portfolio)
- Daily: $5,000 stop if down this much
- Weekly: $8,000 requires full portfolio review
- Trailing stops on all winners above 20% gain

**Profit Taking Rules:**
- Binary events: Sell 50% on initial pop
- Momentum trades: Trail stop at 15% profit
- Short positions: Cover 50% at target 1
- Options: Always sell 50% on doubles

The December catalyst calendar is absolutely loaded. With $78,790 in cash and multiple binary events approaching, we're perfectly positioned to generate explosive returns while managing downside risk. The key is disciplined execution and rapid profit taking on winners.

Stay aggressive but stay disciplined. The next two weeks will define our year.
