## 12. RISK MANAGEMENT & MONITORING PLAN

### Portfolio Risk Parameters:
- **Current Margin Debt**: $75,324 (CRITICAL)
- **Target Cash Level**: $15,000-$25,000
- **Max Single Position**: $10,000 (Several violations)
- **Stop Loss Discipline**: 12% stocks, 15% shorts
- **Daily Loss Limit**: $5,000

### Key Risk Metrics:
- **Portfolio Beta**: ~1.35 (High market correlation)
- **Sector Concentration**: Tech 42% (Too high)
- **Correlation Risk**: High (similar themes)
- **Event Risk**: 8 earnings in next 10 days

### Monitoring Checklist:
1. **Pre-Market (8:00-9:00 AM)**:
   - Review overnight futures
   - Check earnings releases
   - Scan for news on positions
   
2. **Market Hours**:
   - Execute rebalancing trades first hour
   - Monitor stop levels constantly
   - Track margin requirements
   
3. **After-Hours**:
   - Review earnings reports
   - Plan next day's trades
   - Update catalyst calendar

### Contingency Plans:
- **If SPY breaks 690**: Add hedges aggressively
- **If margin call**: Exit lowest conviction immediately
- **If VIX spikes >18**: Reduce all position sizes

**CRITICAL ACTION**: Must reduce margin debt by at least $20K tomorrow through disciplined exits. No new positions until cash balance positive. This is not sustainable portfolio management - we're one gap down away from forced liquidations.
