## 6. MONITORING PLAN

**DAILY MONITORING (Oct 23-Nov 5):**
- **Pre-market**: Check for catalyst news on ARQT, SAVA, RXRX
- **Intraday**: Monitor RGTI for quantum computing news flow
- **After-hours**: Track earnings reactions for RXRX (Oct 28), ARWR (Oct 29)

**CATALYST CHECKPOINTS:**
- **Oct 28**: RXRX earnings - expect 15%+ move
- **Oct 30**: SAVA FDA update - binary 30%+ event
- **Nov 1**: VERB partnership news - monitor volume
- **Nov 4-5**: GKOS/FUBO earnings - final exit decisions

**TECHNICAL TRIGGERS:**
- SMCI: Stop if breaks $41, add if confirms above $48
- VERB: Stop if breaks $4.50, target $8 on volume
- CLOV: Stop if breaks $7, scale out at $10

**PORTFOLIO TARGETS:**
- Week-end target: +8-12% from catalyst captures
- Risk budget: Max -3% portfolio drawdown
- Cash deployment: 75% invested, 25% dry powder

**EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS:**
- If 3+ positions hit stops simultaneously: reduce to 5 positions
- If market volatility exceeds 25 VIX: increase cash to 40%
- If no catalysts materialize: pivot to momentum breakouts
