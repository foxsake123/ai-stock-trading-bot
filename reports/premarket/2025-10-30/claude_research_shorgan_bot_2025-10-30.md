### 4. TOP CATALYST OPPORTUNITIES

**OPPORTUNITY #1: SGEN - FDA BINARY EVENT PLAY**

**Setup Overview:**
Seattle Genetics (SGEN) faces a critical FDA PDUFA decision on November 1 for its bladder cancer drug combination. The stock has pulled back 15% from recent highs, creating an asymmetric risk/reward setup. With positive AdCom vote (9-2) and strong Phase 3 data, approval probability is high while market positioning suggests only 60% priced in.

The opportunity exists because of recent biotech sector weakness and FDA conservatism fears. However, this drug addresses significant unmet need in second-line bladder cancer with compelling overall survival data. Risk/reward favors aggressive positioning.

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Market Cap: $31.2B (mid-cap biotech sweet spot)
- Cash Position: $1.8B (18 months runway)  
- Current Revenue: $2.2B annual (not binary on approval)
- Pipeline Depth: 6 drugs in Phase 2/3
- Short Interest: 8.2% (modest, room for squeeze)

**Technical Setup:**
- Current Price: $172.40
- 52-Week Range: $134.20 - $201.35
- Support Levels: $168 (strong), $162 (critical)
- Resistance: $180 (gap fill), $195 (prior high)
- Volume: Averaging 2.1M shares (liquid)
- RSI: 42 (oversold bounce setup)

**Catalyst Details:**
- PDUFA Date: November 1, 2025 (Friday)
- Expected Timing: Pre-market announcement typical

**OPPORTUNITY #2: CVNA - EPIC SHORT SQUEEZE SETUP**

**Setup Overview:**

Used car prices have stabilized, GPU (gross profit per unit) is expanding, and the company is approaching cash flow positive. The setup mirrors GME/AMC squeeze dynamics with a fundamental catalyst.

Bears thesis relies on outdated bankruptcy concerns while missing operational improvements. With earnings whisper numbers suggesting a beat and potential profitability announcement, this could trigger violent short covering.

- Short Interest: 41% of float (!!)
- Days to Cover: 5.2 (extreme)
- Borrow Rate: 18% (expensive to short)

**Catalyst Details:**
- Earnings Date: November 4 BMO
- Consensus EPS: -$0.42
- Whisper Number: -$0.25 (potential beat)
- Key Metric: GPU expansion + FCF guidance
- Historical Moves: ±15-20% on earnings

**Trade Structure:**
- Entry: $46-48 (accumulate weakness)
- Position Size: 3% of portfolio ($3,300)
- Target 1: $58 (initial squeeze)
- Target 2: $72 (full squeeze)
- Stop: $43 (below support)
- Options: Nov 8 $50 calls for leverage

**Risk/Reward Scenarios:**
- **Bull Case (45%):** Earnings beat + positive FCF = squeeze to $65-75

- **Bear Case (20%):** Miss and guide down, test $40

**Alternative Data:**

**Fundamental Analysis:**
- Market Cap: $118B
- Cash: $11.2B

- Gene Therapy TAM: $5B sickle cell alone
- Competition: Years behind

**Technical Setup:**

### 5. SHORT OPPORTUNITIES

**SHORT IDEA #1: RIVN - EV REALITY CHECK**

- **Cover Target:** $6.50
- **Stop:** $10.25
- **Note:** High borrow cost but fundamental disaster

**PORTFOLIO RISK METRICS:**

**Current Risk Exposure:**
- Portfolio Heat: 18.5% (% at risk if all stops hit)
- Cash Buffer: 74% (excessive - need to deploy)
- Beta-Weighted Risk: 1.15 (slightly aggressive)
- Correlation Risk: Moderate (tech/biotech concentration)

**Position Sizing Rules:**
- Binary Events: Max 2.5% per position
- Momentum Trades: 2-3% positions
- Core Holdings: Up to 5% (high conviction only)
- Short Positions: Max 2% (high borrow risk)
- Options: Max 5% of portfolio in premium risk

**Stop Loss Discipline:**
- Binary Events: Wide stops (8-10%) or none
- Momentum Trades: Tight stops (4-6%)
- Short Positions: MAX 5% loss (high risk)
- Options: 100% loss acceptable (size accordingly)

**Catalyst Concentration Limits:**
- Max 3 binary events same week
- Max 20% portfolio in same sector catalyst
- Diversify across catalyst types (FDA, earnings, data)

**Risk Scenarios to Monitor:**
- Market Risk: SPY below 665 = reduce exposure 50%
- Sector Risk: XBI below 85 = cut biotech exposure
- Correlation Risk: If NASDAQ -3% day = flatten momentum longs
- Volatility Risk: VIX above 25 = reduce position sizes

**Portfolio Optimization Targets:**
- Reduce cash to 40-50% (deploy $30-40K)
- Increase catalyst exposure pre-events
- Take profits aggressively on doubles
- Cut losses fast on broken thesis

**Weekly Risk Checklist:**
- Review all stops and update for volatility
- Check correlation across positions  
- Monitor short borrow rates and availability
- Calculate max portfolio drawdown scenario
- Ensure catalyst calendar not overloaded

**CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS:**
1. Size appropriately for binary events
2. Take profits on parabolic moves (RGTI)
3. Cut losses when thesis breaks (SNDX)
4. Don't override stops in heat of moment
5. Keep powder dry for best opportunities
