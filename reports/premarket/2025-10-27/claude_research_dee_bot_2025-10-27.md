## 2. BETA DRIFT ANALYSIS

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Portfolio beta of 0.46 represents a -0.54 drift from our 1.0 target, far exceeding the 0.15 threshold.

### Root Causes:
1. **Excessive Cash Position**: 45.97% cash vs. 3% target
2. **Underweight High-Beta Names**: Limited exposure to technology and financials
3. **Small Position Sizes**: Several positions under 2% (KO, VZ, PG)

### Required Actions:
- Deploy ~$44,000 in cash to reach appropriate equity allocation
- Add higher-beta quality names to balance portfolio
- Consolidate or exit underperforming small positions

---

## 3. REBALANCING RECOMMENDATIONS

### Positions to Exit:
1. **VZ**: Weak fundamentals, dividend sustainability concerns, minimal position size
2. **PG**: Excellent company but position too small to impact portfolio

### Positions to Add/Increase:
1. **MSFT**: Tech giant, beta ~1.10, exceptional quality
2. **NVDA**: AI leader, beta ~1.70, growth with quality
3. **BRK.B**: Conglomerate, beta ~0.90, Buffett's fortress
4. **JNJ**: Healthcare defensive, beta ~0.70, dividend aristocrat

### Target Portfolio Construction:
- Reduce cash to ~3% ($3,000)
- Increase average position size to 8-9%
- Target 11-12 total positions
- Achieve portfolio beta of 1.0
