## 12. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Position Limits:**
- **Max Position**: $10,000 (10% of capital) - ZM violation fixed
- **Max Sector**: 25% concentration - Biotech at 21% post-rebalance
- **Max Shorts**: 35% of portfolio - Currently 27% short exposure

**Stop Loss Discipline:**
- **Long Stocks**: 12% trailing stop
- **Short Stocks**: 15% stop (tighter due to unlimited risk)
- **Options**: 50% of premium paid

**Risk Metrics:**
- **Daily Loss Limit**: $5,000 (4.4% of portfolio)
- **Weekly Loss Limit**: $10,000 (8.8% of portfolio)  
- **Cash Buffer**: Target $15,000-25,000 (achieved post-rebalance)

**Volatility Management:**
- Holiday week = Reduce position sizes
- Wide bid-ask spreads = Use limit orders only
- Low volume = Avoid illiquid names

**Correlation Risk:**
- Tech longs: DOCU, PATH, AFRM (monitor sector exposure)
- Energy shorts: CVX, CIVI, OXY (working well)
- Biotech longs: ARWR, BEAM, INCY, XBI (JPM Conference risk)

**Black Swan Protection:**
- SPY collar in place
- 25% short exposure provides hedge
- Cash buffer for margin calls

**Key Risk Factors:**
1. **OVERCONCENTRATION FIXED**: ZM from 30.9% → 7.7%
2. **QUANTUM BUBBLE**: IONQ/RGTI shorts could squeeze
3. **BIOTECH BINARY**: JPM Conference high volatility
4. **HOLIDAY LIQUIDITY**: Wider spreads, failed fills

**CRITICAL DISCIPLINES:**
- NO FOMO on quantum computing longs
- STRICT STOPS on all shorts
- SCALE INTO new positions
- PROTECT WINNERS with trailing stops

**Next Week Focus:**
1. Execute rebalancing plan immediately
2. Position for JPM Healthcare Conference
3. Monitor quantum bubble for short entries
4. Prepare for January catalyst surge

---

**FINAL NOTES**: Portfolio desperately needed rebalancing with ZM at 30.9% weight. After trades execute, we'll have proper diversification, $45-50K cash buffer, and positioned for January's catalyst-rich environment. The quantum computing bubble presents exceptional short opportunities while biotech sets up for JPM Conference fireworks. Energy shorts continue working - ride the trend. Next week starts 2026 with massive catalyst potential.
