## 12. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Portfolio Protection Metrics:**
- **Max Position**: $10,000 (Currently: SMCI at limit)
- **Max Sector**: 25% (Currently: Tech at 23%)
- **Stop Loss Rules**: 
  - Longs: 10% (TIGHTENED from 12%)
  - Shorts: 12% (TIGHT discipline on PLUG)
- **Options Limit**: 20% of portfolio (Currently: 5%)
- **Cash Target**: $15,000-$25,000 (Will be ~$14,500 after trades)
- **MARGIN FLOOR**: -$30,000 (Currently -$27,671 - CRITICAL)
- **Daily Loss Limit**: $5,000 hard stop
- **MAX POSITIONS**: 15-20 total (Will be 20 after rebalance)
- **MIN CONVICTION**: 7/10 required (All new entries meet criteria)

**Key Risk Factors This Week:**
1. CPI Tuesday - Could spike volatility
2. NVDA concentration risk - Size appropriately
3. Margin usage - Stay disciplined on stops
4. Earnings volatility - Use defined risk trades

**Daily Monitoring Checklist:**
- [ ] Check margin balance (must stay above -$30K)
- [ ] Review stops on all positions
- [ ] Monitor catalyst calendar
- [ ] Track position weights
- [ ] Calculate daily P&L vs limit

**CRITICAL: After these trades execute, portfolio will have proper margin buffer ($8,500+) and reduced position count (20). Maintain strict discipline on new entries - quality over quantity in this extended market.**
