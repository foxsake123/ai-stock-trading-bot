- **Stop Loss Discipline**: 12% equities, 15% shorts, 8% options
- **Options Allocation**: Max 20% (Currently: 0% - ADDING HEDGES)
- **Cash Buffer Target**: $15-25K (Currently: NEGATIVE - FIXING)
- **Daily Loss Limit**: $5,000 (Alert at $3,000)

**Key Risks This Week**:
1. **Inauguration Volatility**: Policy shocks possible
2. **Bank Earnings**: BAC position at risk
3. **NFLX Binary Event**: Size appropriately
4. **Margin Call Risk**: Must reduce immediately
5. **Overconcentration**: STT/STLA positions

**Risk Mitigation Actions**:
1. Trim all >10% positions TODAY
2. Exit all -10% losers without catalysts
3. Add SPY put spread hedge
4. Set OCO orders on all positions
5. No new positions until cash positive

**Mental Capital Preservation**:
- One catalyst at a time
- Trust the process, not emotions
- Winners run, losers cut
- Size down in uncertainty
- Cash is a position

MONDAY GAME PLAN:
1. Execute all exits at market open
2. Place trim orders on overweight positions
3. Wait for 10:30am volatility to settle
4. Enter new positions in tranches
5. Set all stops before market close

**Expected Portfolio After Rebalance**:
- Cash: ~$5,000 (positive!)
- Positions: ~24 (more focused)
- Max position: <$10,000 (risk compliant)
- Catalyst exposure: 80%+ (quality > quantity)

The market is giving us a gift with inauguration volatility - aggressive traders feast on fear. Time to clean house and position for the catalysts ahead. Bank earnings Tuesday could shake the whole market. Be ready.
