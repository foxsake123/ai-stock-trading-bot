5. Conviction 7+ required for ALL new trades

**Monday Priorities:**
1. Execute all exits at open to fix margin
2. Let market settle 30 minutes before new buys
3. Set GTC orders for new positions
4. Update stops on all remaining positions

This aggressive rebalancing will reset the portfolio for February's catalyst-rich environment while maintaining strict risk controls. The margin violation MUST be corrected immediately on Monday morning.
