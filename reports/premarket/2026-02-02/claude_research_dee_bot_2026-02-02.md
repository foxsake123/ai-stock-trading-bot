**Report Conclusion:**

DEE-BOT's defensive portfolio remains well-positioned with a 1.03 beta and strong quality bias. The rule-based trim of INTC (up 24.5%) follows our discipline of taking profits when fundamentals deteriorate. Adding PEP and MMM enhances defensive characteristics while maintaining income generation. With 19 high-quality holdings and modest cash reserves, the portfolio is structured to preserve capital while capturing steady returns in the current environment.

**Next Actions**: Execute Monday's trades and monitor BAC/V for potential averaging down opportunities if support levels are tested with improving fundamentals.
