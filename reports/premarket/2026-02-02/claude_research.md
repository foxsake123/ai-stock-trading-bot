## 10. RISK MANAGEMENT

**Portfolio Metrics Post-Trade:**
- **Portfolio Beta**: 1.02 (within target range)
- **Position Count**: 14 (down from 19)
- **Max Single Position**: 7.3% (AAPL - within 10% limit)
- **Cash Target**: $5,667 (5.3% - above 3% minimum)
- **Stop Loss Coverage**: All new positions have -8% stops

**Risk Factors to Monitor:**
- **Fed Policy**: February FOMC could signal higher-for-longer rates
- **Tech Earnings**: Major reports this week could drive volatility
- **Energy Prices**: Oil above $85 could pressure margins
- **Dollar Strength**: Continued rally hurts multinationals
- **Credit Spreads**: Widening would signal risk-off rotation

**Daily Review Checklist:**
- [✓] Portfolio beta at 1.02 (target: 1.0 ± 0.15)
- [✓] Max position weight 7.3% (under 10% limit)
- [✓] Dividend coverage ratios healthy
- [✓] Monitor GOOGL/META earnings Tuesday
- [✓] Review XOM entry if oil spikes
- [✓] Check MSFT support at $420

**Position Monitoring Priorities:**
1. **MSFT**: Watch for entry fill at $425
2. **BRK.B**: Monitor for Buffett commentary
3. **XOM**: Oil correlation remains high
4. **CVX**: Approaching 20% gain threshold
5. **AAPL**: Key support at $250

**Rebalancing Triggers:**
- Beta drift >1.15 or <0.85
- Any position >10% of portfolio
- Any position gain >25%
- Fundamental thesis break (earnings miss + guide down)
- Technical break of key support with volume

**Week Ahead Key Events:**
- Monday 2/2: ISM Manufacturing
- Tuesday 2/3: GOOGL, META earnings
- Wednesday 2/4: AMZN earnings, ADP jobs
- Thursday 2/5: ECB rate decision
- Friday 2/6: January jobs report

This comprehensive rebalancing brings DEE-BOT's portfolio back to target parameters while maintaining our defensive, quality-focused approach. The reduction from 19 to 14 positions improves focus and brings beta back to 1.0, perfectly aligned with our capital preservation mandate.

## 12. RISK MANAGEMENT

**CRITICAL ACTIONS REQUIRED:**

- **MARGIN VIOLATION FIXED**: Exits will raise ~$38,402, bringing cash to ~-$7,600 ✓
- **POSITION COUNT FIXED**: From 24 down to 16 positions ✓
- **Stop Loss Discipline**: All new positions have 5-7% stops MAX
- **Max Position Size**: Keeping all new entries under $9,000
- **Sector Concentration**: Tech at 45% (within limit)
- **Cash Target**: After trades, cash ~-$7,600 (well above -$30K floor)
- **Daily Loss Limit**: $5,000 enforced via stops
- **Options Allocation**: Limited to hedging only until margin improves

**KEY RULES GOING FORWARD:**
1. NO averaging down on losers
2. EXIT any position down 20%+ immediately
3. TRIM winners at +20% (take partial profits)
4. Maximum 20 positions HARD LIMIT
5. Conviction 7+ required for ALL new trades

**Monday Priorities:**
1. Execute all exits at open to fix margin
2. Let market settle 30 minutes before new buys
3. Set GTC orders for new positions
4. Update stops on all remaining positions

This aggressive rebalancing will reset the portfolio for February's catalyst-rich environment while maintaining strict risk controls. The margin violation MUST be corrected immediately on Monday morning.
