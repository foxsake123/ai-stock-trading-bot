## 2. MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW- **SPY Commentary**: Currently at $677.20, showing strength above 675 resistance. New all-time highs territory suggests bullish momentum continues despite rate concerns.

- **QQQ Commentary**: Tech leadership intact at $596.83. AI momentum and earnings optimism driving tech higher despite elevated valuations.

- **IWM Commentary**: Small-caps at $257.79 showing relative weakness vs large-caps. This divergence creates opportunities in beaten-down small-cap catalyst plays.

- **Upcoming Macro Events** (Next 10 Days):
  - Feb 7: January Jobs Report (critical for Fed path)
  - Feb 11: January CPI Data (inflation checkpoint)
  - Feb 12: Retail Sales Data
  - Multiple Fed speakers throughout week

- **Catalyst-Rich Sectors**: 
  - Biotech (FDA decisions heating up)
  - Energy (earnings season)
  - Consumer (retail earnings wave)

- **Volatility Regime**: VIX ~14 (low vol continues) = cheap options premium for catalyst plays

- **IV Rank Context**: Below 20th percentile marketwide = favorable for option buyers

## 11. RISK MANAGEMENT PROTOCOL

**Daily Loss Limit**: $300 (10% of portfolio)
- Current unrealized loss: -$321.55 (ALERT: Near limit)
- If additional -$50 intraday → Exit weakest positions

**Position Stop-Loss Rules:**
- Stocks: 10-12% hard stop (GTC orders mandatory)
- Options: 50% of premium ($45 loss on LCID calls)
- Shorts: 9.4% stop on SNOW (tighter for shorts)
- **CRITICAL: Place all stop orders immediately after fills**

**Position Sizing Guardrails:**
- Min position: $150 (avoiding over-diversification)
- Max position: $300 (10% of portfolio max)
- Current largest: SOFI at $293 (within limits)
- Max sector concentration: 30% (Tech at 25% - OK)

**Cash Buffer Target**: $400-$600
- Post-execution cash: $1,612.53 (HEALTHY)
- Allows for 3-4 more opportunistic trades
- Margin cushion for volatility

**Options Exposure Limit**: 15% of portfolio ($450 max)
- Current options: $90 (3% - well within limit)
- Room for 1-2 more options trades if needed

**Review Triggers:**
- Portfolio already -10.7% → MAXIMUM FOCUS ON EXECUTION
- Any new position -15% → Mandatory exit
- If LCID breaks $9.50 → Exit regardless of earnings

**Special Considerations for Recovery Mode:**
- Only 8+ conviction trades (RIVN/SOFI qualify)
- Tighter stops on all new positions
- No averaging down on losers
- Take profits aggressively on 15%+ winners

---

**CRITICAL REMINDERS:**
1. This is REAL MONEY - every trade must be justified
2. Account is in recovery mode (-10.7%) - no speculation
3. Execute exits FIRST to free capital
4. Place GTC stop orders IMMEDIATELY after entry
5. Monitor LCID closely - earnings volatility expected
6. SNOW short requires careful monitoring - use alerts
7. Take partial profits if any position hits +15% quickly

**Tomorrow's Priority Sequence:**
1. Exit FDX, NFLX, PLUG at market open
2. Enter RIVN and SOFI positions with limit orders
3. Short SNOW only if it rallies to $160
4. Buy LCID calls after morning volatility settles
5. Set all stop losses as GTC orders
6. Review end-of-day for Monday planning
