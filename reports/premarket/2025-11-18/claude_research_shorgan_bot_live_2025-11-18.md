## 9. RISK MANAGEMENT FOR $3K ACCOUNTS

**CAPITAL PRESERVATION FRAMEWORK:**

**Daily Loss Limit: $300 (10.5% of account)**
- If hit: No new trades for 24 hours
- Review all positions for weakness
- Consider reducing position sizes
- Focus on highest conviction trades only

**Position Sizing Matrix:**
- **Tier 1 (Highest Conviction):** $250-300 per trade
- **Tier 2 (Strong Setups):** $150-250 per trade  
- **Tier 3 (Speculative):** $75-150 per trade
- **Options:** Never exceed $300 per position
- **Total Exposure:** Max 80% invested ($2,289)

**Stop Loss Rules (Non-Negotiable):**
1. **Stocks:** -15% maximum from entry
2. **Options:** -50% or catalyst failure
3. **Tighten on Winners:** Move stop to breakeven at +10%
4. **Trail Stops:** 10% trail after 20% gain
5. **Time Stops:** Exit if no movement in 10 days

**Options-Specific Risk Management:**
1. **Expiry Buffer:** Close all positions 3 days before expiry
2. **IV Management:** Exit before known IV crush events
3. **Spread Width:** Keep spreads narrow ($3-5 wide max)
4. **Greeks Monitoring:** Delta <0.70, Theta <-0.10
5. **Premium Rule:** Never pay >5% of account for single option

**Portfolio Balance Requirements:**
- Maximum 12 positions (8-10 ideal)
- No position >15% of account value
- Keep 20-30% cash at all times
- Sector diversification (no >30% in one sector)
- Balance stocks (70%) with options (30%)

**Psychological Safeguards:**
- No revenge trading after losses
- Take 24hr break after -10% day
- Celebrate wins but stay disciplined
- Review journal weekly
- Never add to losing positions

**Emergency Protocol (if account drops below $2,500):**
1. Immediately close all options positions
2. Reduce to 5-6 core stock holdings
3. Decrease position sizes to $150 max
4. Focus only on A+ setups
5. Build back slowly with 5% position sizes

**Success Metrics:**
- Target: +5-10% monthly growth
- Win Rate Goal: 55-60%
- Risk/Reward: Minimum 1:2 on all trades
- Sharpe Ratio: >1.5 
- Max Drawdown: -15% from highs

**Remember:** Protecting capital is more important than making money. You can't compound gains if you blow up the account. Stay disciplined, follow the rules, and the profits will come.
