## **9. RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK**

### **Portfolio Risk Analysis Post-Trades:**
- **Gross Exposure**: Will increase to ~$165K
- **Net Exposure**: Shift to $45K net long (bullish tilt)  
- **Cash Reserve**: Maintain $40K minimum
- **Correlation Risk**: Quantum names (IONQ, RGTI) must be managed together

### **Position Sizing Discipline:**
- **Binary Events** (FDA, clinical): Max 2% portfolio per position
- **Earnings Plays**: Max 3% for large caps, 1.5% for small caps
- **Short Positions**: Max 2% initial, 3% total exposure
- **Options**: Max 1% premium risk per trade

### **Stop Loss Rules:**
- **Catalyst Trades**: Tight stops 10-15% max
- **Shorts**: Even tighter 7-10% (high squeeze risk)
- **Winners**: Trail stops after 20% gains
- **Options**: Mental stops at 50% of premium

### **Catalyst Timing Management:**
- No more than 3 binary events same week
- Stagger entries over 2-3 days when possible  
- Exit or reduce before ultra-high risk events
- Keep 25% cash for opportunistic trades

### **Maximum Loss Scenarios:**
- **Per Trade**: $2,500 max (2.5% of portfolio)
- **Daily**: $5,000 max (5% of portfolio)
- **Weekly**: $10,000 max (10% of portfolio)
- **Circuit Breaker**: Down 15% = reassess everything

### **Hedging Considerations:**
- SPY puts if net long exceeds $75K
- VIX calls during catalyst clusters
- Sector pair trades to reduce correlation
- Consider index shorts if market overextended

### **Weekly Review Checklist:**
1. P&L by position - what worked/failed?
2. Catalyst outcomes vs. expectations
3. Risk taken vs. reward captured
4. Missed opportunities analysis
5. Position sizing discipline audit
6. Stop loss execution review

## **CONCLUSION: DECEMBER'S CATALYST BUFFET**

We're entering the most catalyst-rich period of Q4 with multiple FDA decisions, critical earnings reports, and year-end positioning dynamics. The portfolio is well-positioned with proven winners like ARQT and IONQ (short) while we hunt for the next explosive moves.

**Key Priorities:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** cover SRRK short - take the loss and move on
2. **EXECUTE** new positions Monday for December catalysts  
3. **MONITOR** existing winners with trailing stops
4. **PREPARE** for volatility around CPI/FOMC

**Expected Portfolio Targets:**
- December 15: $125,000 (capturing 2-3 major catalysts)
- Year-end: $135,000 (35% return beating passive strategies)

The market is giving us gift-wrapped opportunities in biotech binaries, nuclear momentum, and overvalued tech shorts. Time to feast on December's catalyst buffet while others are distracted by the holidays.

Remember: **Tight stops, defined risk, and let winners run!**

*Trade the catalyst, not the company!*
