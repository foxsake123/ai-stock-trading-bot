## 1. MARKET ENVIRONMENT & CATALYST LANDSCAPE

Let me analyze the current market conditions and identify key catalysts for this week:Let me check current prices on all portfolio positions first:### MACRO ENVIRONMENT ASSESSMENT (December 2, 2025)

**Market Indices Status:**
- S&P 500 (SPY): $681.58 - Breaking to new ALL-TIME HIGHS! Up 14% YTD

- Russell 2000 (IWM): $245.14 - Small caps lagging but showing strength
- 10-Year Treasury (TLT): $88.80 - Yields remain elevated around 4.40%

**Current Market Regime: RISK-ON with Selective Rotation**
- Major indices at/near all-time highs indicates strong risk appetite
- Small-cap Russell 2000 underperforming suggests quality bias
- Tech (QQQ) showing leadership with AI/quantum computing themes dominating
- Bond yields stable, suggesting Fed pause expectations are priced in

**Catalyst Environment This Week (December 2-6, 2025):**
1. **Earnings Season Tail End** - Final Q3 reports from retail, tech
2. **FDA Decisions** - Multiple biotech PDUFAs in December
3. **Economic Data** - ISM Manufacturing (Dec 2), Jobs Report (Dec 6)
4. **Year-End Positioning** - Tax-loss selling meets window dressing
5. **AI/Quantum Computing Momentum** - IONQ, RGTI, QBTS running hot

**Volatility Analysis:**
- VIX data unavailable but likely in 13-15 range given market highs
- Options premiums attractive for selling strategies
- Binary event plays offering 50-100% upside on catalysts
- Elevated IV in quantum computing, biotech names

**Small-Cap Momentum Scan ($1B-$10B Market Cap):**
Let me check some high-momentum small caps:**Key Observations for $3K Account:**
- SOFI at $29.54 - Too expensive now for meaningful position size
- AFRM at $67.02 - Also priced out of our range
- Many quality small-caps have run up significantly
- Need to focus on $3-30 range with upcoming catalysts
- Options strategies more important given limited buying power
