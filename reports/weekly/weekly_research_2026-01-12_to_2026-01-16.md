**Detailed Thesis for Top 3:**

1. **NVDA (NVIDIA)** - The AI chip leader is approaching earnings with massive momentum. Data center demand remains insatiable, and the company continues to expand its moat in AI infrastructure. Gaming recovery is an added bonus. Entry before earnings run-up offers excellent risk-reward.

2. **KO (Coca-Cola)** - Classic defensive play offering 3% dividend yield with pricing power in inflationary environment. International expansion and zero-sugar innovation driving growth. Perfect DEE-BOT addition during market uncertainty with reliable cash flows.

3. **PLTR (Palantir)** - Government AI contracts accelerating with defense spending increasing. Commercial business inflection point reached. Data analytics becoming critical for enterprise AI implementations. Strong technical setup with institutional accumulation visible.
